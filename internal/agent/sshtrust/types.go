// Package sshtrust configures a host to trust the trustctl SSH CA. This file is

// reviewed design — additive-first changes, validated reload with rollback, the
// enumerated lockout-failure modes and their mitigations, and the break-glass
// recovery path — lives in docs/design/ssh-trust-rewrite.md.
//
// Splitting the contract (S13.2) from the build (S13.3) is deliberate: this is a
// catastrophic-risk area (a bad rewrite can lock operators out), so the design is
// reviewed before any production behavior exists.
