// Package leader provides single-leader election for the control plane's continuous
// background workers (RESIL-004 / EXC-RESIL-01). When trustctl runs multiple
// control-plane replicas (the HA topology RESIL-002 unlocks), every replica serves
// reads, but only ONE — the leader — runs the workers that mutate shared state on a
// continuous cadence: the projector tailer, the outbox dispatcher, the
// idempotency/outbox GC sweeps, the CRL freshness scheduler, the audit-retention
// worker, and the read-model snapshot worker. This prevents N replicas from
// double-applying (the projector tailer in particular has no other coordination once
// it is past the boot catch-up's advisory lock).
//
// Leadership is a PostgreSQL session-scoped advisory lock (store.TryBecomeLeader): it
// is held for as long as the leader's connection lives and is released AUTOMATICALLY
// by PostgreSQL if that connection drops, so a crashed or partitioned leader frees the
// lock and a follower takes over on its next campaign — failover with no lease timer
// and no extra datastore (CLAUDE.md §5: no Redis). It is fail-safe: a replica that
// cannot win the lock simply stays a follower and serves reads; nothing about
// issuance or query serving depends on being the leader.
