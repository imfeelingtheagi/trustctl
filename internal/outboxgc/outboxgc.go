// Package outboxgc is the outbox retention sweep (SPINE-003): a system
// (cross-tenant) maintenance subsystem that bounds the outbox table so a
// high-volume fleet's one-row-per-external-effect growth cannot accumulate without
// limit. The outbox (AN-6) records every outbound call (upstream CA, connector,
// webhook, notification); on success the dispatcher marks the row delivered, but a
// delivered row is finished work and only needs to live for a short audit /
// observability window. Without a sweep those rows accumulated forever, so the
// table, its indexes, and every backup grew without bound and eventually required a
// manual cleanup/VACUUM.
//
// Like the idempotency-key GC (internal/idemgc) and the audit retention worker
// (internal/audit), this is a system maintenance task that operates across all
// tenants by design, so it runs on the connection pool directly rather than under a
// tenant's row-level-security context — it reclaims every tenant's eligible rows in
// one pass and reads no tenant data into the application. It therefore lives outside
// the repository layer (internal/store and the //trustctl:repository-marked
// orchestrator), whose AN-1 tenant-filter rule governs per-tenant data access, not
// deliberate system-wide retention.
//
// AN-6 (at-least-once delivery) is preserved: only rows whose status is already
// 'delivered' AND whose delivered_at is older than the window are reclaimed. Pending
// and failed rows (the dispatcher's work queue and the dead-letter trail) are never
// touched, so no undelivered effect is ever dropped and stuck/failed entries stay
// visible for operators.

// DefaultRetention is how long a delivered outbox row is kept before the sweep
// reclaims it. A delivered row is finished work, kept only for a short audit /
// observability window, so a day comfortably covers operational inspection while
// keeping the table — and its backups — bounded for a high-volume fleet. The
// authoritative record of the effect lives in the event log and the receiver's
// idempotency ledger, not in the outbox row. It is the documented default; the
// control plane may override the window where the sweep is wired in.

// rows are never matched (status <> 'delivered'), so at-least-once delivery (AN-6)
// and the visibility of stuck/failed entries are preserved. It is safe to call
