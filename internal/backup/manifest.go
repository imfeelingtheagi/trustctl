// The backup-set manifest (SF.4). Disaster recovery is only trustworthy if every
// persistent store is accounted for, so this manifest classifies each PostgreSQL
// table by HOW it is recovered. The manifest test enforces that the classified
// set is exactly the set of tables the migrations create — so a new persistent
// store cannot be added without a deliberate decision about how it is backed up
// and restored. This turns the "any new persistent store joins the backup set"
// convention from prose into an enforced contract.
//
// Recovery classes:
//
//   - RecoveredByLogRebuild — pure projections of the event log (AN-2). The event
//     log is the backup; on restore these are truncated and re-derived by
//     projections.Rebuild. This set must equal store.ReadModelTables (the manifest
//     test asserts it), so a projection table can never drift out of the rebuild.
//   - RecoveredFromPostgresBackup — independent state not derived from the log
//     (tokens, CA material/state, discovery inventory, attestations, the outbox,
//     idempotency keys, audit checkpoints, …). Recovered from the PostgreSQL dump
//     in the backup set.
//   - Ephemeral — state that is NOT required to recover and regenerates on its own
//     (rate-limit token buckets). Captured incidentally by the PostgreSQL dump but
//     never depended on for a correct restore.

// RecoveredByLogRebuild is the event-sourced read model; the event-log backup +
// projections.Rebuild restores it.
