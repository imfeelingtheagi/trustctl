// Package idemgc is the idempotency-key retention sweep (SPINE-002): a system
// (cross-tenant) maintenance subsystem that bounds the idempotency_keys table so a
// high-volume fleet's one-row-per-served-mutation growth cannot accumulate without
// limit, and so completed keys/results are not retained indefinitely.
//
// Like the audit retention worker (internal/audit), this is a system maintenance
// task that operates across all tenants by design, so it runs on the connection
// pool directly rather than under a tenant's row-level-security context — it
// reclaims every tenant's expired rows in one pass and reads no tenant data into
// the application. It therefore lives outside the repository layer (internal/store
// and the //trustctl:repository-marked orchestrator), whose AN-1 tenant-filter
// rule governs per-tenant data access, not deliberate system-wide retention.
//
// AN-5 is preserved within the retention window: a retried mutation that arrives
// before its key expires still finds the cached result, because only keys whose
// completed_at is older than the window are reclaimed. Pending (in-flight) claims
// (completed_at IS NULL) are never touched, so an operation still running is never
// disturbed.

// DefaultRetention is how long a completed idempotency key is kept before the

// high-volume fleet. It is the documented default; the control plane may override
