//
//	Root CA ──ISSUED──▶ Intermediate CA ──ISSUED──▶ payments cert ──DEPLOYED_TO──▶ payments-db
//	                                     └─ISSUED──▶ web cert      ──DEPLOYED_TO──▶ lb-edge
//	payments-svc ─OWNS─▶ payments cert
//	web-frontend ─OWNS─▶ web cert
//	deploy-key   ─GRANTS_ACCESS─▶ bastion-host        (an un-owned, standing-access SSH grant)
//
// Edge direction is "impact flows From→To": compromising From puts To at risk,
// so a node's forward-reachable set is its blast radius.
