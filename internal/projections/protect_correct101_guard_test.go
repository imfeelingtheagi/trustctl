// CORRECT-101 (15-CORRECT) PROTECT regression guard.
//
// Confirmed strength: the served issue/renew/revoke/OCSP/CRL paths PLUS idempotent
// replay have real end-to-end coverage. The anchor is
// internal/projections/issuance_e2e_test.go, which proves (a) a certificate appears
// in the inventory after a real issuance through the assembled control plane and a
// real out-of-process signer, and (b) an idempotent replay of the same mutation does
// NOT mint or record a second certificate (the fingerprint is unchanged).
//
// This is an ANCHOR-LOCK, not a behavioral re-run: the e2e test it protects stands up
// embedded Postgres + NATS + a signer child and is gated out under -short, so it
// cannot be the guard itself within the <30s PG-free budget. Instead this guard reads
// the real e2e source file and asserts the two load-bearing assertions are still
// present and wired the way the strength describes. If a future edit deletes the
// "inventory appears after issuance" assertion or the "idempotent replay keeps one
// cert / same fingerprint" assertion, this guard goes RED — locking the strength so
// the e2e proof cannot be silently gutted while the file still compiles.
