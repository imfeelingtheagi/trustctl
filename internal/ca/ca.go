// Package ca defines the certificate-authority plugin interface and a built-in

// internal authority, and the WASM CA plugins (run on internal/pluginhost) —
// satisfies the same CA interface, so the issuance path is uniform regardless of
// which authority mints the certificate. Issuance runs on the idempotency (AN-5)
// and outbox (AN-6) paths via IssuanceService.
