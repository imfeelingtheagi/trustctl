// This file implements the tamper-evident hash chain over audit records (R2.1).
// Each record is linked to its predecessor: hash_i = SHA256(hash_{i-1} ||
// canonical(record_i without its hash)). Because every link folds in the prior
// hash, altering, dropping, inserting, or reordering any record changes that
// record's link and every link after it — so re-running VerifyChain detects it.
// The head is published in a signed evidence bundle (Bundle.ChainHead), which
// anchors a point in time: an export signed earlier won't match a log tampered
// later. SHA-256 routes through the crypto boundary (AN-3).

// recordCore is the canonical, hash-covered content of a record — everything
// except the chain hash itself, so a record's link can be recomputed
// independently of the (possibly tampered) stored hash.
