// Package webhook is the generic HMAC-signed webhook notification channel (S10.7),
// built from the same notification template as every other channel: it implements
// notify.Notifier and self-validates against the notify.Conform harness (the
// notification analogue of the connector SDK, S5.5). It delivers an Alert by POSTing
// the alert as JSON to a caller-supplied endpoint over HTTP, signing the request body
// with HMAC-SHA256 so the receiver can authenticate it.
//
// Unlike the chat channels (Slack, Teams) whose secret is the webhook URL itself, the
// secret here is a shared HMAC key: the channel computes
// sig := hex(HMAC-SHA256(secret, body)) over the exact JSON body it sends and presents
// it as the X-Trustctl-Signature: sha256=<sig> header. A receiver that holds the same
// key recomputes the MAC over the bytes it received and rejects any request whose
// signature does not match — the standard "signed webhook" handshake. Because the MAC
// covers the body, a tampered payload fails verification.
//
// The secret is the HMAC key and is held as []byte, never a string (AN-8): Go's GC can
// freely copy a string, so key material lives in a byte slice the caller can later
// zero. It is the channel's credential — it is never logged, never written into error
// text, and never placed in the request (only the derived signature is). On a non-2xx
// response the error surfaces the response body (the receiver's own error message,
// which does not contain the key), never the key or the URL (AN-8 lineage — the same
// rule the Cloudflare provider follows for its API token and the Teams channel for its
// URL).
//
// The HMAC is computed through internal/crypto.HMACSHA256, the AN-3 crypto boundary, so
// this package imports no crypto/* directly — only encoding/hex to render the digest.
// When the channel is driven from the notification dispatcher, the outbox provides
// at-least-once delivery (AN-6) and Notify is safe to call more than once for the same
// alert; signing is deterministic, so a re-delivered alert produces the identical
// signature.
