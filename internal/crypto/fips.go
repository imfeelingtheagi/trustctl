// This file is the FIPS posture surface of the AN-3 boundary (PKIGOV-007 /
// EXC-CRYPTO-01). Because crypto/fips140 is itself a crypto/* package, the AN-3
// linter forbids importing it anywhere outside internal/crypto — so the FIPS
// state of the process is read and asserted ONLY here, and the rest of the tree
// (cmd/trstctl, the signer, the orchestrator) reaches it through these
// boundary-agnostic functions rather than importing crypto/fips140 itself.
//
// What "FIPS-capable" means here, precisely. Go 1.24+ ships a FIPS 140-3 Go
// Cryptographic Module: building with the pinned regulated selector
// GOFIPS140=v1.0.0 (or running any build with GODEBUG=fips140=on) routes the
// standard library's crypto/* through that validated module and makes
// fips140.Enabled() report true. trstctl's whole crypto surface enters through
// this one package (AN-3), so when the module is active every signature, hash,
// and AEAD trstctl performs runs inside it.
//
// This is FIPS-*capable*: it uses the Go Cryptographic Module, which has a CMVP
// validation. The trstctl *product's* own NIST CMVP certificate is a separate,
// external process (a lab test + certificate issuance) that code cannot perform;
// it is the named residual of EXC-CRYPTO-01. Two further caveats the POST cannot
// erase: the post-quantum schemes (ML-DSA/ML-KEM/SLH-DSA via CIRCL) are not in
// the module's boundary, and a key custodied in an external HSM/KMS is validated
// by that device, not by this module.

// ErrFIPSRequiredButInactive is returned by the power-on self-test when the
// operator requires FIPS mode (a --fips assert / config flag) but the running
// binary's crypto is NOT routed through the FIPS module — i.e. it was not built
// with GOFIPS140 and GODEBUG=fips140=on was not set. It is the fail-closed signal:
// a deployment that must be FIPS-validated refuses to start in a non-FIPS build
// rather than silently issuing credentials with an unvalidated module.

// PowerOnSelfTest is the cryptographic power-on self-test (POST) trstctl runs at
// startup, before it serves any request (EXC-CRYPTO-01). It does two things:
//
//  1. Always runs a known-answer self-test of the boundary: it generates a key,
//     signs a fixed probe, and verifies the signature, asserting both that a good
//     signature verifies and that a tampered one is rejected (fail-closed). This
//     exercises the live signing/verification path the running binary will use —
//     under the FIPS module when one is active, under the standard library when
//     not — so a broken or mis-linked crypto stack is caught at boot, not on the
//     first issuance. (The Go FIPS module additionally runs its own CASTs the
//     first time it is used; this is trstctl's own end-to-end check on top.)
//
//  2. If required is true (the operator asserted --fips / fips.required), it
//     additionally asserts the FIPS module is active and FAILS CLOSED with
//     ErrFIPSRequiredButInactive when it is not. This is the regulated-deployment
//     guard: a binary that must be FIPS-validated will not boot in a non-FIPS
//     build, so it can never silently fall back to an unvalidated module.
//
// It returns the resolved FIPSStatus alongside any error so the caller can log
// the posture even on the success path. On any error the process must not start.
