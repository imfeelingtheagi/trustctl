// EXC-WIRE-03 — server-side construction of the served policy / RA-separation /
// dual-control gate (api.MutationGate) and the event-store-backed approval recorder
// it consults. Until now the OPA/Rego default-deny engine (internal/policy), the RA
// scope split, and dual-control approval (internal/approval) were library-only
// (SEC-002, SEC-005, CORRECT-003); the served mint was reachable without them
// (RED-004). buildMutationGate assembles them from Deps so the running cmd/trstctl
// binary enforces them on the mutating issue/deploy/revoke path. Everything here is
// tenant-scoped (AN-1, the store enforces RLS), fail-closed, and — for policy —
// audited (AN-2) on the policy bulkhead (AN-7).
