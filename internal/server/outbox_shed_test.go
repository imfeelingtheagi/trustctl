// TestOutboxTickShedUnderSaturationPreservesWork is the CODE-007 regression guard:
// the outbox dispatcher tick is routed through the outbox bulkhead pool, and when
// that pool is saturated the tick is SHED (the rejected Submit is intentionally
// ignored) rather than blocking or piling up sweeps (AN-7). This is documented,
// intentional backpressure — NOT a dropped event — because every outbox row is
// claimed FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED and persists, so the next unsaturated tick
// delivers it.
//
// The test proves both halves of that contract against the real embedded stack:
//
//  1. With the outbox pool's only worker occupied, dispatchOnce returns PROMPTLY
//     (it does not block on the full pool) and the handler is NOT invoked — the
//     tick was shed — and the enqueued row is STILL pending (no work was lost).
//  2. After the pool frees up, a subsequent dispatchOnce delivers the SAME
//     persisted row exactly once.
//
// A regression that made the shed blocking (dropping the select/default), or that
// dropped the row on a shed, fails here.
