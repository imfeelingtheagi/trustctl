// Package protocol defines the versioned wire contract between the in-network agent
// and the control plane (SCHEMA-003). Both binaries import it, so the negotiated
// version and the support window are a single source of truth rather than an
// unenforced convention.
//
// During a rolling fleet upgrade an old agent and a new control plane (and the
// reverse) coexist. The REST surface stays additive by policy, but that alone is a
// convention; this package makes the agent announce its protocol version and lets
// the server make an explicit, documented compatibility decision: an agent within
// the supported window is accepted, one outside it is rejected with a clear,
// actionable error instead of failing in some opaque way later.
