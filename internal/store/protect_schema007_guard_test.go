// SCHEMA-007 (16-SCHEMA) PROTECT regression guard.
//
// Confirmed strength: schema migrations are ORDERED, LEDGERED (schema_migrations),
// ADVISORY-LOCK SERIALIZED (only one instance migrates at a time), FORWARD-ONLY, and
// ONLINE-SAFE (no-transaction migrations may run CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY while the
// run is still serialized). Anchor: internal/store/migrate.go
// (MigrateAdvisoryLockKey, the schema_migrations ledger, sorted apply, recorded
// versions, try-lock probes, no-transaction opt-in).
//
// PG-FREE by design. Two parts: (1) a BEHAVIORAL check on the real embedded migration
// set via the in-package helpers migrationNames()/versionOf() — the list is sorted by
// version, the versions are contiguous (no gaps, no duplicates) and forward-only from
// 1; (2) an ANCHOR-LOCK over migrate.go for the advisory-lock + ledger + sorted-apply
// machinery. It NEVER starts Postgres. If a migration is added out of order, a gap or
// duplicate appears, or the advisory-lock/ledger serialization is removed, this guard
// goes RED.
