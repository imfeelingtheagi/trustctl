-- Certificate profiles (S8.1, F53): the versioned, fine-grained rules that govern
-- issuance — allowed key types/sizes, EKUs, name constraints, validity ceilings,
-- and which enrollment protocols may use a profile. Every issuance path validates
-- against its bound profile before signing.
--
-- Versioning: each edit is a NEW row (a new version); prior versions remain
-- resolvable. At most one version per name is `active` at a time (the one new
-- issuance binds to). Per AN-1 every row carries a tenant_id and is confined by
-- row-level security.
