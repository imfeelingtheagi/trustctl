-- 0017_identity_transitions.sql — lifecycle-history read model (SPINE-001).
--
-- The orchestrator's History/State previously reconstructed an identity's
-- lifecycle by replaying the WHOLE cross-tenant event log on every call
-- (O(total events) per read, plus cross-tenant I/O). This table is the
-- indexed, tenant-scoped read-model projection of the lifecycle transition
-- events (identity.issued, identity.deployed, …): the projector appends one
-- row per transition (the sole writer, AN-2), and History/State read it with a
-- single tenant-scoped, indexed query — O(this identity's transitions), never
-- touching another tenant's rows. The event log stays the source of truth; this
-- table is truncated and rebuilt from the log on a projection Rebuild (AN-2),
-- so it joins ReadModelTables rather than the backup set.
--
-- Per AN-1 the table carries tenant_id and isolation is enforced by row-level
-- security, not application code. seq is the appending event's stream sequence;
-- it is monotonic within a tenant and gives the deterministic transition order
-- a replay reproduces.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS identity_transitions (
    tenant_id    uuid        NOT NULL,
    identity_id  uuid        NOT NULL,

-- The hot read path: an identity's transitions in order, confined to one tenant.
-- The PRIMARY KEY already covers (tenant_id, identity_id, seq) for that lookup;
-- this index serves the by-tenant scan used by State()/History() so the planner
-- never falls back to a sequential scan as the table grows.

-- AN-1: isolation is enforced by row-level security. These rows are written by

-- as well as USING; an unset GUC is NULL, so every row is denied (fail closed).
