-- Agent bootstrap tokens (F3/F15, WIRE-003): durable, tenant-scoped, single-use
-- one-time tokens an agent presents once at /enroll/bootstrap. Previously these
-- lived in a process-local map[string]bool (lost on restart, not shared across
-- instances, and carrying no tenant) — the WIRE-003 defect. Persisting them here
-- makes a token (a) survive a control-plane restart, (b) be redeemable on any
-- instance, and (c) bound to the authorizing tenant so the issued agent
-- certificate can be stamped with that tenant (AN-1). Only the SHA-256 hash of the
-- token secret is stored, never the secret itself (the secret is shown once at
-- mint), exactly like api_tokens.
--
-- Single-use is enforced at redemption by an atomic conditional UPDATE that sets
-- used_at only when the row is still unused and unexpired (see RedeemBootstrapToken);
-- a token redeemed on one instance cannot be redeemed again anywhere.
--
-- Per AN-1 the table carries tenant_id and is confined by row-level security.
-- Minting runs under the authorizing tenant's RLS context; redemption looks the
-- token up by its globally-unique, high-entropy hash as a system operation (the
-- tenant is not known until the token resolves), exactly like api_tokens
-- authentication.
