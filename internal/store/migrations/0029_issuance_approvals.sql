-- 0029_issuance_approvals.sql — served dual-control for privileged issuance/revoke
-- (EXC-WIRE-03; closes SEC-002, the served half of RED-004).
--
-- The RA model and the internal/approval state machine encode "a requester cannot
-- self-issue" and "two distinct approvers are required", but until now they were
-- library-only: no served route recorded or required an approval. This is the
-- served, RLS-isolated read model the gate consults — mirroring the proven
-- ca_key_ceremonies / ca_ceremony_approvals m-of-n pattern (PKIGOV-003/006), but for
-- the issue/revoke lifecycle transition rather than a CA key ceremony.
--
-- A row in issuance_approval_requests records a pending privileged action on a
-- resource (an identity) and the requester who opened it (for opener != approver
-- separation of duties). issuance_approvals records each DISTINCT approver's
-- approval (the PRIMARY KEY makes one approver idempotent). The gate allows the
-- transition only once the distinct-approver count reaches the required threshold,
-- and the store rejects an approval by the requester themselves (self-approval),
-- exactly as the ceremony approval store does.
--
-- Per AN-1 every row carries tenant_id and isolation is enforced by row-level
-- security that is ENABLED and FORCE-d (the table owner must not bypass it), with a
-- WITH CHECK matching the USING clause so writes are confined too (TENANT-008).
