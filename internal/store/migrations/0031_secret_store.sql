-- 0031_secret_store.sql — the served application-secret store (GAP-006 / EXC-WIRE
-- secrets): the relational, RLS-isolated backing for the served secrets API
-- (/api/v1/secrets/store/...) that the secretsdk/secrets engine mounts on the
-- running binary. Until now the secrets/identity frameworks were library-only with
-- zero importers on the served path (GAP-006); this is the table the served secret
-- store reads and writes through.
--
-- Like 0014_credentials (the system upstream-CA/connector secret store) the value
-- is held ONLY as envelope-encrypted ciphertext (internal/crypto/seal): the
-- plaintext never touches this table; `sealed` is wrapped by the deployment KEK and
-- bound to (tenant_id, name, version) as AAD, so a blob cannot be lifted to another
-- row/tenant and still open (AN-8). A rotation bumps `version` and replaces the
-- sealed bytes in place; `version` is the monotonic rotation counter surfaced to the
-- caller. This table is intentionally latest-only; migration 0046 adds
-- `secret_store_versions` for sealed historical versions and point-in-time recovery.
--
-- Per AN-1 every row carries tenant_id and isolation is enforced by row-level
-- security that is ENABLED and FORCE-d (the owner cannot bypass it), with a
-- WITH CHECK matching the USING clause so writes are confined too (TENANT-008). With
-- the tenant GUC unset the predicate is NULL and no rows match — fail closed.
