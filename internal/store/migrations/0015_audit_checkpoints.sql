-- Audit retention checkpoints (R4.4). Each row seals a boundary at which a
-- tenant's audit records up to boundary_seq were archived to cold storage (a
-- signed, offline-verifiable bundle at archive_uri) and pruned from the hot event
-- log. boundary_hash is the audit chain head at the boundary — the seed that keeps
-- the surviving suffix verifiable across the prune, so VerifyChain still holds.
-- Per AN-1 every row carries tenant_id and is confined by row-level security; a
-- checkpoint is per tenant, and a tenant may seal many over time.
