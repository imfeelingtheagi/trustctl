// This file holds the leader-election primitive (RESIL-004 / EXC-RESIL-01): a
// PostgreSQL SESSION-scoped advisory lock that lets exactly one control-plane replica
// run the continuous background workers (the projector tailer, the outbox dispatcher,
// the GC sweeps, the CRL scheduler, the audit-retention worker, the snapshot worker)
// while every replica serves reads. Without it, N replicas each ran those workers
// concurrently — the dispatcher is safe via FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED and the boot
// catch-up via the projection advisory lock, but the CONTINUOUS tailer/scheduler had
// no coordination, so a non-idempotent apply ordering could interleave.
//
// Why a session-scoped advisory lock: it is held for as long as the holding
// connection lives, and PostgreSQL releases it AUTOMATICALLY when that connection
// drops — so if the leader process crashes or its network partitions, the lock frees
// and a follower acquires it on its next campaign (failover), with no lease timer to
// tune and no split-brain window beyond TCP keepalive. It needs no new datastore
// (CLAUDE.md §5: no Redis) and reuses the same mechanism migrations and the boot
// catch-up already rely on.

// LeaderAdvisoryLockKey is the fixed PostgreSQL advisory-lock key a replica takes to
// become the singular leader of the continuous background workers (RESIL-004). All
// replicas of one deployment share the database and this key, so at most one holds it
// at a time. The value spells ASCII "ctllea"; operators can see the held lock in
// pg_locks (locktype = 'advisory'). It is a DIFFERENT key from the migration lock
// (ctlmgr) and the projection catch-up lock (ctlprj) so leadership never blocks — and
// is never blocked by — a migration or a boot catch-up.
const LeaderAdvisoryLockKey int64 = 0x63746C6C6561 // "ctllea"

// ErrNotLeader is returned by TryBecomeLeader when another replica already holds the
// leader lock, so the caller knows to stay a follower (serve reads, run no continuous
// workers) and try again later.

// CAProvisionAdvisoryLockKey serializes the FIRST-BOOT issuing-CA provisioning across
// replicas (RESIL-002). When >1 control-plane replica boots at once against an empty
// shared signer key store, each would otherwise generate its own CA key and race to
// seal it, leaving the replicas disagreeing on the CA. Holding this lock across the
// whole provision (generate → seal → persist the cert) makes exactly one replica
// generate the CA; the others then take the lock, find the persisted cert, and reuse
// the same key (the signer reload-on-miss picks it up from the shared store). The
// value spells ASCII "ctlcap"; it is distinct from the migration / catch-up / leader
// keys so provisioning never blocks them.

// across replicas serializes rather than racing to seal different CA keys. The lock

// like the migration and projection-catch-up locks.
