// ProjectionAdvisoryLockKey is the fixed PostgreSQL advisory-lock key every
// instance takes for the duration of a boot projection catch-up (RESIL-004).
// Because all replicas of one deployment share the database and the key, only one
// catch-up runs at a time: a second replica booting concurrently BLOCKS on this
// lock until the first finishes, then resumes from the advanced checkpoint and has
// little or nothing left to apply. This serializes the otherwise-uncoordinated
// per-replica catch-up into the shared read-model tables, so a non-idempotent
// apply ordering cannot interleave between two projectors. The value spells ASCII
// "ctlprj"; operators can see it held in pg_locks (locktype = 'advisory'). It is a
// DIFFERENT key from the migration lock so a catch-up and a migration do not block
// each other.
