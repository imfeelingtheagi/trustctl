// distinct-approver requirement. They mirror the proven m-of-n CA key-ceremony
// approval store (CreateKeyCeremony plus evidence-backed approval reservation):
// every query is tenant-scoped and runs under row-level security (AN-1), an
// approver's approval is idempotent, and the request opener (requester) may NOT
// approve their own request (opener != approver separation of duties — the
// dual-control invariant).

// ErrSelfIssuanceApproval is returned when the requester of a privileged action
// attempts to approve it themselves. Dual control requires a DISTINCT approver
// (SEC-002, RED-004), so a self-approval is refused and never recorded.
