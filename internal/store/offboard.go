// TenantScopedTables is the authoritative, ordered list of every tenant-scoped
// table OffboardTenant erases (TENANT-002). Order matters: a child that holds a
// foreign key into another tenant table is listed before its parent, so a
// RESTRICT foreign key never blocks the erase (e.g. attestations -> identities ->
// owners/issuers; certificates -> owners; ca_ceremony_approvals -> ceremonies).
// The tenant's own row in `tenants` is deleted last, after all rows that belong
// to it are gone.
//
// AN-1: every entry carries tenant_id and is confined by a FORCE-d
// USING (tenant_id = GUC) row-level-security policy, so OffboardTenant can delete
// from each one under Store.WithTenant and reach only the offboarded tenant's
// rows. A new tenant-scoped table MUST be added here (and to the read-model/backup
// classification) or its rows would survive an offboarding — the offboarding
// completeness test (internal/store offboarding suite / the projections two-tenant
// test) guards that this set stays in sync with the schema.

// TenantDeletionAttestation is the proof-of-erasure OffboardTenant returns: the

// zero everywhere. It is the record an operator keeps to attest a contractual
// data-deletion / right-to-erasure request was honored. It carries no secret
// material (counts only), so it is safe to log and to project into an audit event.

// OffboardTenant erases every tenant-scoped row for tenantID and returns a
// deletion attestation (TENANT-002). It is the data-retention / right-to-erasure
// primitive enterprise procurement requires: after it returns Complete, the
// tenant's certificates, sealed secrets, SSH keys, inventory, CA state, audit
// checkpoints, and operational rows are gone from PostgreSQL.
//
// It runs in a single transaction under the tenant's RLS context
// (Store.WithTenant), so every DELETE is confined to this tenant by the same
// FORCE-d USING (tenant_id = GUC) policy that confines a read — it is safe by
// construction and can never delete another tenant's rows (AN-1). After deleting,
// it re-counts each table in the same transaction and FAILS CLOSED (returns an
// error, rolling the whole erase back) if any tenant-scoped row survives, so a
// partial erase is never reported as complete. An empty tenantID is rejected
// (RLS would make the GUC NULL and silently match nothing — a fail-open we
// refuse, mirroring TENANT-003).
//
// AN-2 note: this is the relational erase. The event log is the source of truth;
// the caller emits a `tenant.offboarded` event (projections.EventTenantOffboarded)
// in the same flow so the offboarding is itself event-sourced and reconstructable,
// and the projector replays it through OffboardTenant on a Rebuild so a rebuilt
// read model does not resurrect a deleted tenant. Object-store audit-archive residue
// (cold-storage bundles) is out of band and is documented in docs/limitations.md as
// operator-driven cleanup.
