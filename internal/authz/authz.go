// Package authz implements role-based access control (F8): permissions, roles
// (built-in and custom), project/team scopes, and the allow/deny decision. It is
// a pure decision engine — it holds no transport or storage concerns — so the API
// enforcement middleware and any future caller share one authorization model.
//
// A Principal carries the role grants resolved for a request; each Grant pairs a
// Role with the Scope it applies in. Authorization succeeds only when a grant's
// scope covers the target and its role allows the permission, and never across a
// tenant boundary.
