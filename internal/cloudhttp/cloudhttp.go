// Package cloudhttp is the thin shared HTTP round-trip used by trustctl's cloud
// provider families (KMS backends, DNS-01 providers) so the common request/response
// plumbing — bounded reads, non-2xx error normalisation, JSON decode, a per-call
// timeout floor, and a request-signing seam — lives in one place instead of being
// copy-pasted into each provider's package-local call()/do() (CODE-006).
//
// It deliberately does NOT own auth or URL construction: each provider still builds
// its own *http.Request (endpoint, path, query, and the credential — a bearer token,
// an API-key header, an AWS SigV4 signature, or Akamai EdgeGrid — which is
// provider-specific and must stay local so it is never logged, AN-8). cloudhttp owns
// only the parts that were genuinely identical across providers:
//
//   - apply a per-call timeout floor when the caller's context has no deadline,
//   - hand the request to a per-call Signer (the SigV4/EdgeGrid seam) just before it
//     is sent, so a signing provider shares this core without exporting its keys,
//   - send the request through an injectable Doer (so tests pass a double),
//   - read the body under a fixed cap so a hostile/huge response cannot exhaust
//     memory,
//   - turn a non-2xx status into a normalised *StatusError carrying the status and a
//     bounded, credential-free snippet of the body,
//   - decode a 2xx JSON body into out (when out != nil) or drain-and-discard it.
//
// No cryptographic operation happens here, so it imports no crypto/* (AN-3): a
// signing provider passes a Signer closure that computes its keyed MAC through the
// internal/crypto boundary and only mutates request headers — the key never crosses
// into this package.
//
// Adoption (CODE-006): every cloud provider family now routes its JSON/REST
// round-trip through cloudhttp.JSON —
//   - the bearer/API-key KMS backends internal/kms/gcpkms and internal/kms/azurekv;
//   - internal/kms/awskms, which passes a SigV4 Signer (its keyed MAC stays in the
//     awskms package, behind the crypto boundary) so AWS keeps its request signing
//     while sharing the bounded-read / timeout-floor / error-normalisation core;
//   - the eight internal/dns/* DNS-01 providers (cloudflare, ns1, azuredns, googledns,
//     ultradns, acmedns over their bearer/API-key headers; aws-route53 over a SigV4
//     Signer; akamai over an EdgeGrid Signer). The signing DNS providers carry their
//     keyed MAC through internal/crypto exactly as before; only the transport core is
//     shared. A single change to the timeout floor, the body bound, or the non-2xx
//     normalisation here is now inherited by every provider at once.
