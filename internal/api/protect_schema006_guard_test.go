// SCHEMA-006 (16-SCHEMA) PROTECT regression guard.
//
// Confirmed strength: the REST API is versioned under /api/v1, generated from a route
// registry (so the served surface and the published OpenAPI contract cannot drift),
// and guarded against blanks. Anchor: internal/api/api.go (the route registry) +
// internal/api/openapi.go (buildSpec, built once from that registry).
//
// This is a BEHAVIORAL test: api.New tolerates nil dependencies "when only the spec is
// needed" (per its doc comment), so we build a real API with nil store/idem/orch and
// exercise the actual exported Routes() and Spec(). No Postgres, no NATS, no network.
// It asserts the version prefix on every route, that the registry is non-empty, that
// the in-memory OpenAPI document was built from the registry, and the no-blank
// property (every route has a path + operation id; every documented operation has an
// operationId and at least one response). If a future route escapes /api/v1, or the
// spec stops being generated from the registry, or a blank slips in, this guard goes
// RED.
