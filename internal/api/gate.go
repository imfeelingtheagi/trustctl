// EXC-WIRE-03 — the served mutation gate. Until now the OPA/Rego default-deny
// policy engine (internal/policy), the RA separation (certs:request ≠ certs:issue,
// internal/authz), and dual-control approval (internal/approval) were library-only:
// modeled and unit-tested but enforced on no served route (SEC-002, SEC-005,
// CORRECT-003). RED-004 — "the loaded gun" — is precisely that the served mint was
// reachable without these checks. This gate wires them onto the served
// issue/deploy/revoke lifecycle transition so the running binary, not just a test,
// enforces them.
//
// The gate runs in the synchronous request handler (transitionIdentity), BEFORE the
// orchestrator records the lifecycle event and enqueues the outbox mint/revoke
// effect. That is the only seam where the authenticated principal is in context
// (the async outbox dispatcher has none), which the RA scope split and the
// distinct-approver check both require. It is tenant-scoped (AN-1): the policy
// input, the audit event, and the approval lookup all carry the request's tenant.

// PolicyEvaluator is the default-deny decision the gate consults on every served
// mutating lifecycle transition. *policy.Engine satisfies it. It is fail-closed,
// audited (AN-2), and runs under its own bulkhead (AN-7) — the engine owns those
// concerns, so a saturated policy pool or an evaluation error denies rather than
// blocking issuance.

// defense), or when the approver is not permitted. The served implementation is
