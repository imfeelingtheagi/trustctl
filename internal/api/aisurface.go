// This file is the SERVED AI / RCA / NL-query / MCP surface (SURFACE-003 / F75/F76/
// F77/F78). Until now internal/aimodel, internal/rca, internal/mcpserver, and
// internal/query were a library island: real, tested code that NO served composition
// imported, so the advertised AI features ran in no binary. Here that island is
// mounted on the running control plane behind the SAME authenticated, RBAC-gated,
// tenant-scoped path every other read route uses:
//
//   - POST /api/v1/ai/query  — a typed semantic/NL query over the tenant's own data
//     surfaces (owners, certificates, graph, CBOM, the event log), answered ONLY from
//     the caller's tenant under PostgreSQL RLS (AN-1), denied before any read if the
//     principal lacks a surface's read permission (F75).
//   - POST /api/v1/ai/rca    — a grounded root-cause / NL question answered ONLY from
//     cited real records gathered through the same scoping seam; every claim carries a
//     citation, and "insufficient evidence" is preferred to a guess (F77).
//   - GET  /api/v1/mcp/tools — list the READ-ONLY MCP tools an external AI agent may
//     call (F78). There are no write/remediation tools.
//   - POST /api/v1/mcp/tools/{tool} — invoke one read-only MCP tool, tenant-scoped,
//     rate-limited, grounded-and-cited, injection-inert (the retrieved data is inert).
//
// The security model the library proved (SURFACE-I02) is preserved by construction:
//   - Tenant floor (AN-1): the tenant is the authenticated principal's, NEVER a request
//     field; the query engine reads under RLS for that tenant only and drops foreign
//     events from the (non-RLS) log in-process. A caller cannot name another tenant.
//   - Read-only: there is no action/remediation path. The MCP surface exposes only the
//     four read tools and HasWriteTool() is false.
//   - Injection-inert: retrieved records (a SAN, a secret name, an evidence summary)
//     are treated as untrusted DATA, never as instructions; there is nothing the model
//     could be induced to DO.
//   - Secret egress (AN-8): when a model IS configured, every prompt crosses
//     aimodel.Adapter.Reason, which redacts with aimodel.DefaultRedactor and then
//     REFUSES the send on any residual high-entropy run (SURFACE-004). The default is
//     NO model (air-gapped/opt-in per the product posture): grounding + citations still
//     work, the synthesized text is the cited evidence itself, and nothing phones home.
//
// The whole surface is OFF unless the server wires WithAISurface (fail closed), and
// each route is registered in the route registry with a read permission so guard()
// enforces RBAC + the per-tenant rate limiter + CSRF before the handler runs.

// AISurfaceBackend is the dependency set the served AI/RCA/MCP surface needs. The
// server builds it (wiring the tenant-scoped query.Engine, the AN-2 event log as an
// auditor, and the optional, opt-in model adapter) and hands it in via WithAISurface,
// so the api package owns the HTTP surface while the composition stays in
// internal/server.
