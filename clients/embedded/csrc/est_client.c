/*
 * trustctl-est-client (S8.6): a lightweight POSIX EST (RFC 7030) /simpleenroll client for
 * constrained devices. It has no library dependencies beyond libc and the openssl CLI: it
 * generates the device key + PKCS#10 and parses the issued certs-only PKCS#7 via `openssl`,
 * and speaks HTTP over a POSIX socket. TLS is expected to be terminated by an on-device
 * proxy or added with mbedTLS in a real deployment; this reference keeps the transport
 * minimal so it builds anywhere (cc -O2 -o est_client est_client.c).
 *
 * Usage: est_client <base-url> <workdir>
 *   e.g. est_client http://127.0.0.1:8080 /tmp/enroll
 * On success it writes <workdir>/cert.pem and exits 0.
