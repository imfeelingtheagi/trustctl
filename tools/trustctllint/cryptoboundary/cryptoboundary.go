// Package cryptoboundary implements the AN-3 architecture rule: the standard
// library's crypto and crypto/* packages may be imported only from within
// internal/crypto (and its subpackages), which is the one sanctioned
// cryptography boundary. Every other package must route crypto operations
// through that boundary's interfaces.
//
// AN-3 covers more than the standard library. CLAUDE.md §2 says "no crypto
// imports exist anywhere else" and the contract's intent is one auditable
// cryptography boundary; a package that pulled a third-party cipher
// (golang.org/x/crypto, github.com/cloudflare/circl) outside internal/crypto
// would defeat that just as surely as importing crypto/x509 (CRYPTO-002).
// So third-party crypto modules are forbidden outside the boundary too — but
// only in production (non-test) files: differential/conformance tests
// legitimately drive a reference implementation (the upstream ACME or SSH
// client) as a known-good oracle (CLAUDE.md §6), which is a test concern, not a
// handler/service pulling crypto outside the boundary. The stdlib crypto/* ban
// stays absolute (every file) as before.
