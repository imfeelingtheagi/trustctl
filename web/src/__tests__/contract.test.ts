//
// The committed web/src/lib/api-types.gen.ts is generated from the SERVED OpenAPI
// contract (internal/api/testdata/openapi.golden.json, pinned == the live spec by the
// Go test TestOpenAPIGolden). This test re-runs that generation and asserts the
// committed file matches it byte-for-byte — the same check `npm run build` runs via
// `gen:api --check`, here as an explicit unit test so a backend field change that was
// not regenerated into the FE types fails the FE suite, not just the build. It also
// proves the gate is not vacuous: an injected mismatch is detected.
