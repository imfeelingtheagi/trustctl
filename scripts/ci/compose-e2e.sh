# scripts/ci/compose-e2e.sh — EXC-GATE-01 end-to-end gate against the running stack.
#
# The caller (the CI job) brings up the compose eval stack and exports BASE_URL
# (e.g. https://localhost:8443). This proves the SHIPPED deployment works end to end
# against real external PostgreSQL + NATS + the separate isolated signer process:
#   1. the control-plane container boots and serves (/readyz),
#   2. served auth + RLS hold (unauthenticated 401; a bootstrapped token 200),
#   3. a real event-sourced mutation round-trips (create owner -> read it back),
#   4. the served issuance lifecycle runs: issue a cert, RETRY the issuing transition
#      with the same Idempotency-Key and assert NO second credential (AN-5), revoke,
#   5. the served PKI surfaces are mounted: ACME /directory advertises newOrder +
#      revokeCert, the OCSP responder answers for the tenant, and EST /cacerts hands
#      back the issuing CA chain (which the CI job then lints with zlint).
#
# The bootstrap API token is minted INSIDE the running control-plane container
# (`docker compose exec ... trustctl token create`): the compose Postgres has no host
# port and the token must land in the same database the server reads, so the
# network-trust-free first-run bootstrap (WIRE-002) runs where the DSN resolves. This
# is exactly the operator's real first-run step.
#
# Requires: docker compose (the eval stack up), a reachable served control plane
# (BASE_URL), curl, jq, openssl.
