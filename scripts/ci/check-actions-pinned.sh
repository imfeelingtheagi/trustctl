# check-actions-pinned.sh — enforce that every THIRD-PARTY GitHub Action a
# workflow `uses:` is pinned to a full 40-hex commit SHA, never a mutable tag
# (SUPPLY-002). A tag like `@v4` is mutable: an upstream account compromise can
# repoint it, and our release pipeline runs build-push/cosign/sbom while holding
# `packages:write` + `id-token:write`, so a poisoned action could exfiltrate the
# OIDC token or push a malicious image under our own signed identity (cf.
# tj-actions/changed-files, 2025). A commit SHA is immutable, so this guard fails
# CI if any external action regresses to a floating tag.
#
# Exception: slsa-github-generator's official generic reusable workflow rejects
# SHA refs and requires an exact vX.Y.Z tag. That workflow is itself the OIDC
# signing boundary for SLSA provenance, so this guard allows ONLY that exact
# workflow path and ONLY an exact semver tag; @v2, @main, and every ordinary
# action still fail.
#
# Scope: a "third-party" action is any `uses:` whose value names an external repo
# (`owner/repo[/path]@ref`). Local (`./...`) and container (`docker://...`)
# actions are out of scope. (Today every action we use is third-party; there are
# no first-party actions to exempt.)
#
# The single check below is unit-tested by check-actions-pinned_selftest.sh.
