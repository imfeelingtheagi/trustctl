# coverage-server-lifecycle.sh — the assembled-control-plane lifecycle coverage floor
# (R4.3), extracted from the inline `make test` awk so it can be self-tested
# (TEST-007: the gate-of-the-gate, like coverage-critical.sh).
#
# The four core lifecycle functions of the assembled server (server.Build /
# server.IssueLeaf / server.Drain / server.Shutdown) read ~0% IN-PACKAGE but are
# exercised by the cross-package projections e2e under `-coverpkg=./...`; this floor
# surfaces and guards their REAL merged coverage so CI reports the assembled server
# honestly, not the misleading in-package figure. The gate also fails if fewer than
# all four functions are present in the profile (a regression that dropped the e2e
# from the merged run, hiding the number).
#
# Input: the output of `go tool cover -func=<merged-profile>`, whose lines look like
#   trustctl.io/trustctl/internal/server/server.go:123:\tBuild\t85.0%
# i.e. field 1 = file:line:, field 2 = function name, field 3 = NN.N%.
#
# Usage:
#   go tool cover -func=cover.out.nogen | scripts/ci/coverage-server-lifecycle.sh
#   scripts/ci/coverage-server-lifecycle.sh <func-output-file>
#
# Env (with defaults):
#   SERVER_FILE_RE             regex matching the server.go path (default below)
#   SERVER_LIFECYCLE_FUNCS     '|'-separated function names (default Build|IssueLeaf|Drain|Shutdown)
#   SERVER_FUNC_COVERAGE_MIN   per-function floor, percent (default 70)
#   SERVER_LIFECYCLE_COUNT     how many of the funcs must be present (default 4)
#
# Exit: 0 if all named lifecycle funcs are present AND each is at/above the floor; 1
# otherwise. eval_lifecycle is pure text processing so the self-test runs without Go.
