# coverage-critical.sh — per-package coverage gate for the security-critical
# packages (SF.1).
#
# The repo-wide gate in `make test` enforces only an *aggregate* floor: the
# average can clear the bar while a critical package quietly rots. This gate
# closes that hole by requiring EACH critical package to independently meet a
# floor, computed from the merged `-coverpkg=$(GO_COVER_PACKAGES)` profile that `make test`
# already writes (so it sees coverage delivered by cross-package integration
# tests, not just in-package unit tests).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci/coverage-critical.sh [profile]
#
# Inputs (env, with defaults):
#   COVERPROFILE            merged, generated-excluded profile (default cover.out.nogen)
#   CRITICAL_COVERAGE_MIN   per-package floor, percent (default 70)
#   CRITICAL_PKGS           space/newline-separated import paths to gate
#
# Exit status: 0 if every critical package is at or above the floor; 1 otherwise
# (printing each offender). The evaluator (eval_profile) is pure text processing
# over the Go coverprofile format so it can be unit-tested without running Go.

# eval_profile <profile> <min> <pkg...>
# Computes per-package statement coverage from a merged -coverpkg profile and
# fails (returns 1) if any named package is below <min> or absent from the
# profile. Coverage lines look like:
#   import/path/file.go:12.34,56.7 3 1
# where field 2 is the statement count for the block and field 3 the exec count.
#
# A merged -coverpkg profile can contain the same source block once per test
# binary. The block's source position is the stable identity; count its
# statements once, and mark it covered if ANY duplicate row has count > 0. This
# matches the meaning operators expect from a merged profile: unique source
# statements covered by the whole test run, not duplicate uncovered copies from
# unrelated test binaries.
