# Backup, restore & disaster recovery

trustctl is **event-sourced** (AN-2): the event log is the source of truth, and the
relational read model is a pure projection of it. That makes recovery concrete —
restore the event log, rebuild the read model, and the control plane's state is
reconstructed. This page covers what to back up, how to restore, the recovery
objectives, and the DR runbook.

## The backup set

Back up **all** of the following. The convention is that **any new persistent
store joins this set** — if a feature adds a datastore, its backup is part of this
list. This is **enforced, not assumed**: a manifest test
(`internal/backup` `TestBackupManifestCoversEveryPersistentStore`) classifies every
table the migrations create as recovered by replaying the event log, recovered from
the PostgreSQL dump, or ephemeral, and fails the build if a new table is left
unclassified — so a store cannot silently fall out of the recovery plan.

| What | Why | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Event log** (NATS JetStream) | The **source of truth** (AN-2). Restoring it reconstructs all event-sourced state (owners, issuers, identities, certificates, lifecycle, and the attributed audit trail). | `trustctl --backup=events.jsonl` (portable, versioned), or back up the JetStream `store_dir` / cluster. |
| **PostgreSQL** | The read model is rebuildable from the log, but **non-event state** lives here: API tokens, CT-monitoring config/checkpoints, and rate-limit buckets. | `pg_dump` (standard). The read model itself is restored by the rebuild, below. |
| **Audit export signing key** | So pre-restore signed evidence bundles still verify (R2.1). | Copy `TRUSTCTL_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` to secure storage. |
| **KEK** (key-encryption key) | The root of trust for everything sealed at rest: stored credentials (R3.1) **and** the signer's CA key (R3.2). Without it, sealed material cannot be opened. | Copy `TRUSTCTL_SECRETS_KEK_FILE` to secure storage, separately from the sealed data it protects. |
| **Signer CA key store** | The issuing CA's private key, **sealed at rest** (R3.2). Restoring it preserves the CA identity. | Back up the signer's key-store directory (`--keystore`); it holds only ciphertext. |
| **Issuing CA certificate** | So the control plane reuses the same CA cert across a restore (stable identity). | Copy `TRUSTCTL_CA_CERT_FILE`. |

The signer's CA key is now **persisted, sealed at rest** (R3.2) — it survives a
restart and is part of the backup set above. Restore it (the sealed key store) and
the KEK into a fresh signer to recover the CA identity; see Scenario B below. Keep
the **KEK separate** from the sealed data it protects.

## Backing up the event log

```bash
# Requires the external event store (TRUSTCTL_NATS_MODE=external).
trustctl --backup=/backups/trustctl-events-$(date +%F).jsonl
# -> "backed up <N> events to ..."
```

The backup is **newline-delimited JSON** — a self-describing, versioned header
followed by one record per event (id, type, tenant, time, data, and the recorded
actor), and a final **integrity trailer**. It is portable and inspectable, and it
captures the complete envelope so the recovered audit trail is intact.

**Integrity (OPS-006).** The trailer carries a **SHA-256** over the entire stream
(header + every record), so a bit-flip, a truncation, or a removed record is
detected — `--restore` recomputes the hash and **refuses a tampered or corrupt
backup, fail-closed**, before appending a single event. When the deployment has a
persisted audit signing key (`TRUSTCTL_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`), the trailer also
carries an **HMAC-SHA256** derived from that key, binding the backup to this
deployment so an attacker who can rewrite the file cannot forge a matching
trailer. All hashing/MAC routes through the `internal/crypto` boundary (AN-3); the
signer is not involved (AN-4). Keep the audit key with your backups so a keyed
backup verifies on the recovery host.

## Restoring

Restore into a **fresh, empty** event store and a PostgreSQL instance, then rebuild:

```bash
# Requires external Postgres and NATS, and an EMPTY event store.
trustctl --restore=/backups/trustctl-events-2026-05-31.jsonl
# -> "restored <N> events from ... and rebuilt the read model"
```

`--restore` re-appends every event in order (preserving ids, timestamps, and
actors) and then **rebuilds the relational read model purely from the restored
log** (the AN-2 rebuild). It refuses a non-empty event store so a misdirected
restore can never duplicate the stream. For the non-event PostgreSQL state (API
tokens, CT config), restore the `pg_dump` separately.

A backup → restore → rebuild drill is exercised in CI
(`TestBackupRestoreDRDrillReproducesState`): it asserts the recovered inventory
**matches the source** — the same rebuild-from-log equivalence the architecture
guarantees.

## Recovery objectives (RPO / RTO)

These are **defaults to validate against your own infrastructure**, not promises —
they depend on how often you back up and how fast your datastores restore.

- **RPO (data loss window):** the age of your most recent backup. With continuous
  JetStream replication (external cluster) the RPO approaches **zero**; with
  periodic `trustctl --backup` it equals the **backup interval** (e.g. 24 h). Back
  up at the cadence your RPO target requires.
- **RTO (time to recover):** restore the datastores, run `trustctl --restore`, and
  start serving. The rebuild is a single pass over the log (tens of milliseconds
  for thousands of events; minutes for very large logs). Plan an RTO that covers
  provisioning + datastore restore + rebuild + a smoke test.

## High availability (multi-replica by default)

The default Helm chart runs the control plane **multi-replica** (`replicaCount: 2`)
with a no-downtime `RollingUpdate` (`maxUnavailable: 0`), a PodDisruptionBudget
(`minAvailable: 1`), and pod anti-affinity (RESIL-002 / EXC-RESIL-01). A node failure
or a config rollout no longer takes issuance/validation offline. Three mechanisms make
running more than one control-plane replica **safe**:

- **Leader election for the continuous workers (RESIL-004).** A single leader (via
  leader election) — exactly one replica —
  the **leader** — runs the workers that mutate shared state on a continuous cadence:
  the outbox dispatcher, the audit-retention worker, the idempotency/outbox GC sweeps,
  the projection tailer, the CRL freshness scheduler, and the read-model snapshot
  worker. Leadership is a PostgreSQL **session-scoped advisory lock**
  (`store.LeaderAdvisoryLockKey`, "ctllea"): the leader holds it for as long as its
  connection lives, and PostgreSQL **releases it automatically** if the leader crashes
  or partitions, so a follower acquires it on its next campaign (failover) with no
  lease timer to tune. Every replica serves reads regardless. Toggle with
  `ha.leaderElection` (on by default; harmless on a single replica, which always wins
  the lock). The **boot projection catch-up** is independently safe on every replica:
  it takes the projection advisory lock (`ProjectionAdvisoryLockKey`, like migrations)
  so concurrent boots serialize and each resumes from the shared projection checkpoint
  (SPINE-007).
- **A shared signer key store so every replica is the same CA.** The control plane
  still co-locates the signing service as a locked-down sidecar reachable only over a
  shared in-memory Unix domain socket (AN-4) — the supported topology, **not** the
  not-yet-built isolated-mTLS one. For HA the signer key store and the control-plane
  data dir default to **ReadWriteMany** (`persistence.signerKeysAccessMode` /
  `persistence.controlPlaneAccessMode`), so every pod's sidecar signer loads the SAME
  sealed issuing-CA key and every replica serves the same CA cert and verifies the
  same audit chain. First-boot CA provisioning is serialized by an advisory lock
  (`CAProvisionAdvisoryLockKey`) so exactly one replica generates the key; a follower
  signer that started first reloads it from the shared store on demand (reload-on-miss)
  rather than reporting it missing. Run an RWX-capable StorageClass (NFS/EFS/Filestore/
  Azure Files); set both back to `ReadWriteOnce` for a single-replica eval.
- **Constant-time boot via snapshots (SPINE-007).** The leader periodically writes a
  per-tenant read-model snapshot at the current projection checkpoint
  (`ha.snapshotInterval`, default ~5m). On a cold boot / DR restore the read model is
  rehydrated from the latest snapshot and only the **tail** after it is replayed, so
  startup is `O(events-since-snapshot)`, not a full-log replay. The event log remains
  the source of truth (AN-2): a snapshot is reproducible by a full `Rebuild`, and a
  corrupt or missing snapshot falls back to a full replay automatically.

Durability still lives in the **datastores** (external PostgreSQL + replicated NATS):
the event log is the source of truth and a rebuilt pod re-derives state from it, so a
control-plane failure is an availability event, not a data-loss one.

**The still-deferred piece — isolated signer (SIGNER-005).** A single signer pod
serving all replicas over **mTLS gRPC** (`signer.mode: isolated`) is a future topology
(the `trustctl-signer` binary is UDS-only today, so selecting it **fails the Helm
render** with guidance rather than shipping a crash-looping pod, OPS-001). It is not
required for the HA above — the shared-keystore sidecar model already gives a single,
consistent CA across replicas — but it would let the signer scale independently of the
control plane. For a single-replica eval set `replicaCount: 1` and the access modes to
`ReadWriteOnce`; the PDB is then irrelevant (disable it, since a `minAvailable: 1` PDB
would block a single-replica node drain).

## DR runbook

### Scenario A — loss of the datastore (PostgreSQL and/or NATS)

1. Provision fresh PostgreSQL and NATS (empty).
2. Point trustctl at them (`TRUSTCTL_POSTGRES_*`, `TRUSTCTL_NATS_*`).
3. Run `trustctl --restore=<latest event-log backup>` — this restores the log and
   rebuilds the read model.
4. Restore the `pg_dump` for non-event state (API tokens, CT config) if needed.
5. Restore the audit signing key (`TRUSTCTL_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`).
6. Start the control plane; confirm `/readyz` is green and spot-check the inventory.

### Scenario B — loss of the signer host (recover the CA, no rotation)

The issuing CA key lives in the out-of-process signer (AN-4) and is now
**persisted, sealed at rest** (R3.2). A signer-host loss does **not** mean a new CA
— restore the sealed key store and the KEK and the **same CA is back**:

1. Provision a fresh signer host/container.
2. **Restore the signer's sealed key store** (`--keystore` directory) and the
   **KEK** (`TRUSTCTL_SECRETS_KEK_FILE`) from backup. Keep them from separate
   backups — the KEK opens the sealed keys.
3. Start `trustctl-signer --keystore <dir> --kek <kek>`; it reloads the sealed CA
   key. Restore `TRUSTCTL_CA_CERT_FILE` so the control plane reuses the same CA
   certificate. The CA identity is unchanged; already-issued certificates keep
   verifying and no re-issuance is needed.

If the CA key **and** its backup are both lost (true catastrophe), fall back to a
planned CA rotation: already-issued certificates remain valid until expiry, stand
up a new CA, re-issue, and distribute the new bundle — see the
[incident-response runbook](runbooks/incident-response.md) and the m-of-n
[key-ceremony runbook](runbooks/key-ceremony.md). HSM/KMS-backed custody and a
served break-glass flow remain future work.

See [Configuration → Datastores](configuration.md#datastores) and
[Configuration → Signer](configuration.md#signer-topology--ca-custody) for the
settings these procedures use.
