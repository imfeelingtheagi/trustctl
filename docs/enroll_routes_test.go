// TestEnrollRenewalDisclosedAsNotServed is the reality-bound disclosure for DOCS-001:
// enrollment-protocols.md previously claimed POST /enroll/renewal "is mounted and
// served," but the running binary's API mounts ONLY POST /enroll/bootstrap, so a
// renewal request 404s. This test binds the doc to the served code, in both
// directions:
//
//   - while the served API does NOT mount renewal, the doc must say so (no "renewal
//     ... mounted and served" over-claim, and an explicit not-yet-mounted/404
//     statement) and link the wire-in epic;
//   - if a future change mounts renewal (the route appears in internal/api), the
//     stale not-served disclosure must be retired.
//
// The behavioral companion is internal/api/TestEnrollRoutesServed, which drives the
// real mux and asserts bootstrap serves while renewal 404s.
