# Audit trail & compliance

certctl's audit trail is a **projection of the event log** (AN-2): every
state-changing operation is recorded as an immutable event, and the audit
query/export endpoints derive their views from that log. This page describes what
the audit subsystem **gives you** and — just as importantly — what it **does
not** do for you. certctl provides controls and evidence; **certification is yours
to obtain with your auditor**. Nothing here is a claim that deploying certctl
makes you compliant.

## What the audit subsystem provides

- **Completeness.** Every served mutation is recorded as an event (AN-2), so the
  trail reconstructs the full history of owners, issuers, identities, issuance,
  and revocation. The relational read model is a projection of the same events.
- **Attribution — who did what, when, under what authorization.** Each event
  carries the authenticated **actor** (subject and the role names it acted under),
  set from the verified principal (token or OIDC session, R1.2), plus the event
  time and tenant. A reconstructed trail answers "who revoked this credential, at
  what time, under which role."
- **Tamper-evidence.** Audit records are **hash-linked**: each record's hash folds
  in its predecessor's, so altering, dropping, inserting, or reordering any record
  changes that record's hash and every hash after it. The chain-verification
  routine detects it and names the first broken record.
- **Signed, offline-verifiable evidence export.** `GET /api/v1/audit/export`
  returns a compact JWS bundle (records + the chain head) signed with a
  **persistent** key, so a bundle exported today still verifies after a restart.
  An auditor verifies the signature and recomputes the chain offline.
- **Tenant isolation.** Every audit query is tenant-scoped (AN-1).

## The tamper-evidence trust model (read this)

The event log lives in NATS JetStream with **append-only file storage**. On top of
that, certctl maintains an application-level **hash chain** over the audit records
and publishes the chain head inside each **signed** export. The signed export is
the *anchor*: an export captured at time T attests to the exact records and head
at T, and any later alteration of the underlying log produces a different head
that no longer matches the trusted, signed bundle.

What this **does** detect: alteration, truncation, insertion, or reordering of
records relative to a previously signed bundle, and any in-place edit of a signed
bundle (the signature fails).

What it does **not** do by itself: provide continuous at-rest notarization without
a reference point. For that, an **operator** schedules periodic signed exports
(for example a nightly `certctl-cli audit export`) and retains them in
write-once / WORM storage; each export anchors the log up to its point in time. A
future hardware-anchored or external-notary checkpoint is a roadmap item.

## What the operator must still do

certctl enables the controls below; **you** operate them:

- **Custody and back up the export signing key** (`CERTCTL_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`,
  written `0600`). Losing it means past bundles still verify (you keep the public
  half) but you cannot produce new bundles under the same key; rotating it changes
  the verification key your auditor pins.
- **Distribute the verification (public) key** to auditors out of band.
- **Set a retention policy — certctl can now enforce it.** By default the event log
  is **retained indefinitely** (no pruning). When you set **both**
  `CERTCTL_AUDIT_RETENTION` (a window, e.g. `8760h`) **and**
  `CERTCTL_AUDIT_ARCHIVE_DIR`, a background worker enforces it: see
  [Audit retention and archive lifecycle](#audit-retention-and-archive-lifecycle) below.
  Pointing `CERTCTL_AUDIT_ARCHIVE_DIR` at WORM-backed storage is still your call.
- **Schedule periodic signed exports** to anchor the log over time (above).
- **Run the rest of the program**: access reviews, change management, incident
  response, vendor management, and the framework-specific evidence your auditor
  requires.

## Audit retention and archive lifecycle

When `CERTCTL_AUDIT_RETENTION` and `CERTCTL_AUDIT_ARCHIVE_DIR` are both set, a
bounded background worker (per tenant, AN-1; hourly cadence) enforces the policy in
four ordered steps, so the configuration does real work rather than merely
documenting intent:

1. **Archive.** Records older than the window are signed as a self-contained,
   offline-verifiable bundle (a compact JWS) and written to
   `ARCHIVE_DIR/<tenant>/audit-<sequence>.jws` (`0600`). Verify any archive with the
   audit verification key, exactly like a live export.
2. **Verify.** The worker re-verifies the bundle it just wrote — it recovers and its
   hash chain checks out — **before** anything is deleted. A bundle that fails
   verification aborts the run; nothing is pruned.
3. **Seal a checkpoint.** A signed checkpoint records the boundary (sequence + the
   audit chain head at that point) in `audit_checkpoints` (tenant-scoped, RLS). The
   checkpoint is the surviving records' new chain anchor.
4. **Prune.** Only now are the archived records deleted from the hot event log. The
   surviving records hash-link onto the checkpoint, so **`VerifyChain` still holds
   across the prune** and a previously exported bundle still verifies. Each run also
   emits an `audit.archived` event (itself auditable) and increments
   `certctl_audit_records_archived_total`, `certctl_audit_records_pruned_total`, and
   `certctl_audit_retention_runs_total` on `/metrics`.

Each archived segment chains onto the previous one (its `prev_hash` is the prior
segment's head), so the **archive bundles plus the live log are the authoritative
history**: a full disaster-recovery rebuild restores from the archive **and** the
live log together. Archiving to immutable/WORM storage (and protecting it) remains
the operator's responsibility. This is the one place certctl deletes from the event
log, and it does so only after archive → verify → seal.

## Framework mapping — *enables* vs. operator responsibility

This maps the controls certctl's audit/identity subsystems **help satisfy**. It is
not an attestation; an assessor decides whether your overall program meets each
control.

| Framework | Controls certctl's audit trail helps with | Still the operator's |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SOC 2 | CC7.2/7.3 (security event logging), CC8.1 (change tracking) — *attributable, tamper-evident event trail + signed evidence* | Monitoring/alerting program, change-management process, retention enforcement, the audit engagement |
| ISO 27001 | A.8.15/8.16 (logging, monitoring), A.5.28 (evidence collection) — *event capture + exportable evidence* | Log review cadence, retention schedule, ISMS scope and operation |
| PCI DSS v4 | Req. 10 (log and monitor access) — *who/what/when trail*; 10.5 — *enforced retention: archive to signed bundles → checkpoint → prune, when configured* | 10.5 the chosen window (≥12 months) + WORM archive storage + 3-readily-available copies, daily review, FIM, key custody |
| HIPAA | §164.312(b) audit controls — *recording and examining activity* | §164.308 review procedures, retention (6 years), BAAs |
| FedRAMP / NIST 800-53 | AU-2/3 (event content), AU-9 (protection of audit info, via the chain + signed export), AU-11 (retention — *enforced archive + prune when configured*), AU-12 (generation) | AU-6 review, AU-11 retention schedule + WORM storage, AU-9 storage hardening (WORM), FIPS-validated crypto (a build caveat) |

**Defensible today:** an attributable, tamper-evident, event-sourced audit trail
with signed, offline-verifiable evidence export, multi-tenant isolation, and
**enforced retention** (archive → checkpoint → prune, chain-verifiable across the
prune) when a window and an archive directory are configured.
**Explicitly not claimed:** that certctl is "compliant" or "certified" with any
framework, that FIPS-validated cryptography is in the default build, or that your
archive storage is WORM-hardened (that is yours to provide).
