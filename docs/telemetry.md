# Telemetry (opt-in, off by default)

trstctl can send a small amount of anonymized usage data to help the project
understand adoption and prioritize work. **It is off by default and never sends
anything unless you explicitly turn it on.** This is a decided, privacy-first
position for a self-hosted product used in regulated environments.

## What is sent (only when enabled)

A single JSON document, at most once per interval:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "instance_id": "9f2c…",          // random, generated once, never host-derived
  "version": "v1.2.3",
  "os": "linux",
  "arch": "amd64",
  "credential_buckets": {            // counts BUCKETED into coarse ranges by type
    "x509_certificate": "101-1000",
    "ssh_key": "1-10"
  }
}
```

- **`instance_id`** — a random 128-bit identifier generated on first use and
  stored locally. It is not derived from your hostname, IP, MAC, organization, or
  any credential. The receiver counts distinct IDs to estimate active
  deployments; that figure is treated as a lower bound.
- **`credential_buckets`** — how many credentials of each *type* you manage,
  reported as a coarse range (`0`, `1-10`, `11-100`, `101-1000`, `1001-10000`,
  `10000+`). Exact counts never leave the process.

## What is never sent

No credential content or metadata of any kind: no subjects, SANs, serials,
fingerprints, public keys, or expiry dates. No owner identities, emails, team
names, hostnames, IP addresses, file paths, CA names, or connector targets. No
configuration values. If a field could identify you or your credentials, it is
not in the payload — by construction, the payload struct has no place to put it.

## How to opt in

Telemetry is enabled only when you set it explicitly:

```bash
# environment
export TRSTCTL_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
# optional overrides
export TRSTCTL_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=https://telemetry.trstctl.com/v1/usage
export TRSTCTL_TELEMETRY_INTERVAL=24h
export TRSTCTL_TELEMETRY_INSTANCE_ID_FILE=/data/telemetry/instance-id
```

or in the config file:

```json
{ "telemetry": { "enabled": true, "interval": "24h" } }
```

When enabled, the endpoint must be an absolute `https://` URL and the interval a
positive Go duration. `TRSTCTL_TELEMETRY_INSTANCE_ID_FILE` must name a writable
local file for the random anonymous instance ID. trstctl validates this on boot
and refuses to start on a bad telemetry configuration. A typo in
`TRSTCTL_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` (anything that is not a recognized boolean) is
ignored and leaves telemetry **off**.

Air-gapped installs are stricter: when `TRSTCTL_AIRGAP_ENABLED=true`, trstctl
refuses to start with `TRSTCTL_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`. That turns "off by
default" into "off by policy" for disconnected environments. See
[Air-gapped install](airgap.md) for the no-phone-home runtime guard and Helm
overlay.

## Verifying the current setting

```bash
trstctl -check-config | grep telemetry
# telemetry.enabled: false
```

## How to opt out

Do nothing — it is already off. If you previously enabled it, set
`TRSTCTL_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` (or remove the config key) and restart. You may
also delete the stored `instance_id` file; a new random ID is generated only if
you opt in again.
