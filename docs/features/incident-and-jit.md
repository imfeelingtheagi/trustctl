# Incident response & just-in-time access — contain compromise, gate access

## What it is

Sometimes a credential leaks, a [CA](../glossary.md) is compromised, or someone needs
emergency access right now. This page covers the four workflows trstctl provides for
those moments: a **credential-compromise workflow** that re-issues and revokes a leaked
credential and everything downstream of it; **fleet re-issuance** to replace every
certificate from a compromised CA; **just-in-time (JIT) issuance** that grants access
only after approval; **JIT privileged access sessions** for Postgres and SSH; and
**break-glass** emergency signing for when the control plane itself is down.

The mental model: this is the fire department and the keymaster combined. The compromise
workflow and fleet re-issuance are the fire response (contain and rebuild without leaving
anyone locked out); JIT is the keymaster who only hands out a key after a second person
signs off; break-glass is the sealed emergency key behind glass that takes two officers
to use.

## Why it exists

The worst time to invent a process is during an incident. A leaked key needs to be
replaced *and* every credential that depends on it rotated, in the right order, without
creating an outage. A compromised CA can mean thousands of certificates to re-issue —
impossible by hand, dangerous without health checks. And standing, always-on access is
itself a risk: JIT replaces "everyone has access all the time" with "access is granted,
approved, and expires." Each workflow is built to be safe under pressure: ordered,
audited, idempotent, and reversible.

## How it works

### Credential compromise workflow (F31)

When one credential identity is compromised, the danger is everything it can reach. The
served workflow starts with a read-only **blast-radius snapshot** from the
[graph](graph-query-ai.md), then executes the containment path idempotently — every
state-changing request takes an `Idempotency-Key`, so a retry never applies the change
twice: it creates a replacement identity, issues it, deploys it through the connector
outbox, and only then revokes the compromised identity. The result is recorded as an
immutable `incident.execution.recorded` evidence pack — with the replacement id,
revocation queue status, connector delivery receipt, failed-target list, rollback
references, and a sealed audit bundle — and its outbound deliveries are journaled first
so a crash can't drop them.

This is deliberately stricter than probectl's guarded-remediation pattern. probectl
proposes and records remediation; trstctl's remediation actually executes issue,
deploy, and revoke work after a human operator trigger. For that reason the served
route is an Enterprise `remediation` feature: Community returns 404, and licensed
deployments still require RBAC (`incidents:write` and `certs:issue` for replacement
issuance) before anything mutates.

The same incident surface can open a **ServiceNow / ITSM workflow** after the
operator has enough evidence. `POST /api/v1/itsm/servicenow/tickets` records an
immutable `itsm.ticket.requested` event, then enqueues `itsm.servicenow` in the
outbox in the same tenant-scoped transaction. The outbox worker resolves
`token_ref` only when it is ready to call the ServiceNow Table API; the token value is
never stored in the event log, outbox payload, UI, or audit response. The request is
idempotent like every other mutation: replaying the same `Idempotency-Key` returns the
same queued receipt instead of creating a second ticket request.

Detection is served on the Discovery side, not hidden inside remediation. A
`credential_compromise` source accepts metadata-only ITDR, honeytoken,
secret-scanner, IdP, SaaS, or threat-intel signals and emits
`compromised_credential` findings tagged `CAP-ITDR-02` and OWASP NHI2. Those
findings carry credential references and evidence refs only; the raw stolen token
or secret body never enters the control plane. Operators can use those findings as
the evidence that justifies the incident execution path above.

OAuth consent abuse is served through the same Discovery spine. An `oauth_grant`
source still emits ordinary `oauth_grant` inventory findings for CAP-OAUTH-01, and
it emits an additional `oauth_grant_abuse` finding tagged `CAP-ITDR-03` only when
the grant export has concrete abuse evidence such as provider threat signals,
dangerous wildcard / `.default` scopes, `offline_access` plus high-privilege admin
consent, explicitly unverified publisher evidence, ownerless privileged third-party
admin consent, or suspicious redirect URIs. The finding stores evidence references
and source event ids, not OAuth client secrets, access tokens, or refresh tokens.

Supported tables are `incident`, `change_request`, and `sc_task`. Production
endpoints must be public HTTPS by default; `allow_private_endpoint` exists for
operator-controlled private/eval instances and is explicit in the request.

For a broader response packet, `POST
/api/v1/incidents/response-integrations/dispatch` records
`response.integration.dispatched` and fans out one tenant-scoped outbox row per
destination: Splunk HEC (`response.splunk`), Jira issue creation
(`response.jira`), Slack/operator notification (`notification.response`), and
ServiceNow Table API (`itsm.servicenow`). Each destination carries only endpoint
metadata plus `token_ref`; token bytes are resolved by the worker at delivery time
and wiped after the outbound request. This is a served dispatch and evidence path,
not a promise that trstctl manages the customer's Splunk correlation searches,
Jira automation rules, Slack app installation, or bidirectional ServiceNow state
sync.

### Fleet re-issuance for CA compromise (F32)

If a *CA* is compromised, every certificate it signed must be replaced. trstctl finds
them all via the graph, rotates the CA key first (so new certificates sign under a fresh
key), then re-issues in **health-checked batches**: after each stage it runs a health
check, and if that fails it **rolls back** that stage and halts rather than charging
ahead into an outage — batches run in a bounded lane that rejects overload fast rather
than starving other work. It's **resumable** — a progress store records completed
credentials so an interrupted run picks up where it left off without re-issuing anything,
because re-issuance is idempotent and outbound work is journaled first so a crash can't
drop or duplicate it. For an SSH CA it re-establishes trust and publishes an updated KRL
*after* confirmed-healthy re-issuance.

**Status:** compromised-issuer fleet re-issuance is served through
`POST /api/v1/incidents/fleet-reissuance-runs`, with list/get evidence at
`GET /api/v1/incidents/fleet-reissuance-runs{,/{id}}`, pause/resume/rollback evidence
at `POST /api/v1/incidents/fleet-reissuance-runs/{id}/{pause,resume,rollback}`, and a
signed evidence export at
`GET /api/v1/incidents/fleet-reissuance-runs/{id}/evidence`. The run enumerates the
tenant's affected identities by issuer, batches the replacements, deploys replacements
before revoking originals, records connector delivery receipts, and projects
`incident.fleet_reissuance.recorded` evidence. CLI parity is
`trstctl-cli incidents fleet-reissuance start|list|get|pause|resume|rollback|evidence`.

### Just-in-time issuance with approval (F33)

JIT turns issuance into an approval workflow. A request enters `awaiting-approval` and
notifies approvers (Slack/Teams) — nothing is issued yet. Approvals are **dual-control**
by default (2 required, configurable for m-of-n), **self-approval is blocked**, approvers
can be policy-scoped, and the request is **time-bounded** (it expires if not approved in
time). One denial is terminal. When the quorum is met, trstctl issues and transitions to
`issued`. Approve/deny take an `Idempotency-Key` and are no-ops once a request is
terminal, so a retry never double-acts, and every step is recorded as an immutable event
(`approval.requested/approved/denied/issued/expired/refused`).

For privileged-access management, the same JIT model opens short-lived sessions instead
of standing database or shell access. `POST /api/v1/access/sessions` verifies an
attestation, grants a scoped Postgres login role or signs an OpenSSH user certificate
for a configured SSH target, returns the one-time credential to the caller, and records a
tenant-scoped session row. The session expires automatically: Postgres roles are revoked
by the background expiry worker, and SSH access ends at the certificate `valid_before`
time. The event trail is filterable by `pam.session.started` and
`pam.session.expired`; credential material is not written into those events.

**Status:** the core identity approval gate is served through
`POST /api/v1/identities/{id}/approvals`, ephemeral/JIT credential issuance is served
when configured through `POST /api/v1/ephemeral` plus
`POST /api/v1/ephemeral/{request_id}/approvals`, and PAM-lite sessions are served
through `POST /api/v1/access/sessions`, `GET /api/v1/access/sessions`, and
`GET /api/v1/access/sessions/{id}`. The ephemeral path verifies the attestation first,
writes the approval request and outbox notification intent in the same tenant
transaction, blocks requester self-approval, then mints a short-TTL credential only
after a distinct approver records approval. CLI parity is `trstctl-cli ephemeral issue`
and `trstctl-cli ephemeral approve`; PAM sessions use `trstctl-cli access sessions open`,
`trstctl-cli access sessions list`, and `trstctl-cli access sessions get`.

### Break-glass procedures (F34)

If the control plane is reachable during an incident, `POST /api/v1/breakglass/issue`
serves online emergency issuance gated by an **m-of-n operator quorum**: a sub-quorum
request fails closed. The escrow signing key is a handle into the separate, isolated
signing service, never caller-supplied key material in the API process. The result is a
**self-verifying signed bundle** — anyone can verify it offline (signature + chain to
the CA), and the served route reconciles it into the hash-chained audit log as
immutable `breakglass.issued` before responding. If the control plane was unreachable,
operators can still run the same quorum ceremony offline and later call
`POST /api/v1/breakglass/reconcile`, which verifies those bundles against
deployment-pinned break-glass verifier material and records the same audit event. A
bundle that fails verification stops the batch, so a forged emergency issuance can't be
silently absorbed.

### In the console

The `/incidents` screen is the response console: a served **blast-radius** preview for the
compromised identity, replacement-before-revoke execution with the resulting evidence,
automated remediation playbooks for revoke / rotate / NHI right-size, a
SIEM/SOAR/chat/ITSM response-dispatch form for Splunk, Jira, Slack, and ServiceNow, a
ServiceNow ITSM ticket form that queues the Table API call through the outbox, and a
**break-glass reconciliation** panel that folds offline-issued, quorum-approved bundles
back into the event log (`/api/v1/breakglass/reconcile`). The self-service approvals inbox at
`/approvals` blocks self-approval of your own request. See
[The web console](../web-console.md).

## Use it

Credential compromise is served through REST, CLI, and the console:

```bash
trstctl incidents executions execute -f incident.json
trstctl incidents fleet-reissuance start -f compromised-issuer.json
trstctl incidents fleet-reissuance pause 33333333-3333-4333-8333-333333333333 -f pause.json
trstctl incidents fleet-reissuance evidence 33333333-3333-4333-8333-333333333333
trstctl incidents response-integrations dispatch -f response-dispatch.json
trstctl itsm servicenow tickets create -f servicenow-ticket.json
trstctl remediation playbooks
trstctl remediation playbooks run nhi-right-size -f right-size.json
trstctl remediation playbook-runs list --playbook_id nhi-right-size
trstctl incidents executions list --identity_id 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
trstctl incidents executions get 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222
```

```json
{
  "identity_id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
  "reason": "private key export detected",
  "replacement_name": "payments-api-incident-replacement",
  "connector": "nginx",
  "target": "edge/prod/payments",
  "delivery_rollback_ref": "restore previous fullchain"
}
```

Dispatch the same incident response packet to Splunk, Jira, Slack, and ServiceNow:

```bash
trstctl incidents response-integrations dispatch -f response-dispatch.json
```

`response-dispatch.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "Contain compromised payments credential",
  "summary": "Rotate, revoke, page responders, and open investigation.",
  "severity": "critical",
  "correlation_id": "incident-2026-06-25",
  "evidence_refs": ["incident/22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"],
  "destinations": [
    {
      "id": "splunk",
      "provider": "splunk",
      "endpoint_url": "https://splunk.example.com/services/collector",
      "token_ref": "env:TRSTCTL_SPLUNK_TOKEN"
    },
    {
      "id": "jira",
      "provider": "jira",
      "endpoint_url": "https://jira.example.com",
      "project_key": "SEC",
      "issue_type": "Task",
      "token_ref": "env:TRSTCTL_JIRA_TOKEN"
    },
    { "id": "slack", "provider": "slack", "channel": "security-incidents" },
    {
      "id": "servicenow",
      "provider": "servicenow",
      "instance_url": "https://example.service-now.com",
      "table": "incident",
      "token_ref": "env:TRSTCTL_SERVICENOW_TOKEN"
    }
  ]
}
```

Queue a ServiceNow incident ticket from the same response surface:

```bash
trstctl itsm servicenow tickets create -f servicenow-ticket.json
```

`servicenow-ticket.json`:

```json
{
  "instance_url": "https://example.service-now.com",
  "table": "incident",
  "token_ref": "env:TRSTCTL_SERVICENOW_TOKEN",
  "short_description": "Rotate exposed TLS private key",
  "description": "trstctl incident response queued replacement-before-revoke remediation.",
  "category": "security",
  "urgency": "1",
  "impact": "2",
  "correlation_id": "incident-2026-06-25"
}
```

Equivalent REST call:

```bash
curl -fksS -X POST "https://trstctl.example.com/api/v1/itsm/servicenow/tickets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRSTCTL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: incident-2026-06-25-servicenow" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"instance_url":"https://example.service-now.com","table":"incident","token_ref":"env:TRSTCTL_SERVICENOW_TOKEN","short_description":"Rotate exposed TLS private key","description":"trstctl incident response queued replacement-before-revoke remediation.","category":"security","urgency":"1","impact":"2","correlation_id":"incident-2026-06-25"}'
```

The caller needs `incidents:write`. The returned receipt names the outbox row and
`idempotency_key`; the worker marks that row delivered only after ServiceNow accepts the
Table API request.

Online break-glass issue is API-served when the signer-backed break-glass issuer is
configured:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://trstctl.example.com/api/v1/breakglass/issue" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRSTCTL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: incident-2026-06-25-bg-issue" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"request_id":"bg-001","subject":"recovery.svc.example.test","csr_der":"...base64-csr...","reason":"regional outage","approvals":["op1","op2"],"ttl_seconds":900}'
```

Break-glass reconciliation remains API-served after an offline ceremony:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://trstctl.example.com/api/v1/breakglass/reconcile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRSTCTL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: incident-2026-06-25-bg-reconcile" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bundles":[{"request_id":"bg-001","subject":"recovery.svc.example.test","cert_der":"...base64...","reason":"regional outage","approvals":["op1","op2"],"issued_at":"2026-06-25T17:00:00Z","signature":"...base64..."}]}'
```

The caller needs `certs:issue`; audit readers can then confirm the result with
`GET /api/v1/audit/events?type=breakglass.issued`.

Open a short-lived Postgres session:

```bash
curl -fksS -X POST "https://trstctl.example.com/api/v1/access/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRSTCTL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: incident-2026-06-25-pg-readonly" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target_type":"postgres","target_id":"pg-main","role":"readonly","reason":"production incident 42","method":"k8s_sat","payload_base64":"...","ttl_seconds":900}'
```

The response includes the session id, expiry, and a one-time Postgres DSN. Store it
only in the process that will use it. After `expires_at`, the background worker revokes
the generated database role and records `pam.session.expired`.

Open a short-lived SSH session:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f /tmp/pam_id
curl -fksS -X POST "https://trstctl.example.com/api/v1/access/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRSTCTL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: incident-2026-06-25-ssh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target_type":"ssh","target_id":"ssh-edge","role":"user","reason":"production incident 42","method":"k8s_sat","payload_base64":"...","ssh_public_key":"'"$(cat /tmp/pam_id.pub)"'","ssh_principal":"alice","ttl_seconds":900}'
```

Write the returned `ssh.certificate` value to `/tmp/pam_id-cert.pub` and connect with
the matching private key. The target host must trust the trstctl SSH CA through its
`TrustedUserCAKeys` configuration.

The lower-level library shapes remain useful for tests and future batch workflows:

```go
// Compromise library: preview the blast radius, then remediate idempotently
report := incident.Preview("cert:abc123")            // read-only: what's affected
_, err := incident.Remediate(ctx, "cert:abc123", "idem-key-xyz")

// JIT: request, then two distinct approvers (dual control) → auto-issue
approval.RequestIssuance(ctx, approval.RequestSpec{ID: "req-001",
    Resource: "cert:db-tls", Requester: "alice", RequiredApprovals: 2})
approval.Approve(ctx, "tenant1", "req-001", "bob")
approval.Approve(ctx, "tenant1", "req-001", "carol")  // quorum met → issues
```

Blast-radius preview reads the same [credential graph](graph-query-ai.md) you can query
directly; incident execution also appears in `/incidents` in the console. JIT
notifications use the [notification integrations](policy-and-governance.md).

## Pitfalls & limits

- **Serving status:** credential-compromise execution (F31) is served through
  `/api/v1/incidents/executions`, `trstctl incidents executions *`, and `/incidents`;
  automated remediation playbooks (CAP-REM-01) are served through
  `/api/v1/remediation/playbooks`,
  `/api/v1/remediation/playbooks/{id}/runs`,
  `/api/v1/remediation/playbook-runs{,/{id}}`, `trstctl remediation playbooks*`,
  and `/incidents`; NHI right-size runs require usage-backed CAP-POST-01 posture
  evidence and queue `connector.right_size` through the outbox;
  CA-compromise fleet re-issuance (F32) is served through
  `/api/v1/incidents/fleet-reissuance-runs`,
  `trstctl incidents fleet-reissuance *`, and the `/incidents` console;
  compromised-credential / stolen-token detection (CAP-ITDR-02) is served through
  `credential_compromise` Discovery sources, runs, and findings; malicious /
  abused OAuth-grant detection (CAP-ITDR-03) is served through `oauth_grant`
  Discovery sources, runs, and `oauth_grant_abuse` findings;
  SIEM/SOAR/chat/ITSM response dispatch (CAP-REM-03) is served through
  `/api/v1/incidents/response-integrations/dispatch`,
  `trstctl incidents response-integrations dispatch`, and `/incidents`;
  ServiceNow / ITSM ticket creation is served through
  `/api/v1/itsm/servicenow/tickets` and the `/incidents` console. JIT issuance is
  served. Online m-of-n break-glass issuance is served at
  `/api/v1/breakglass/issue`, and offline-bundle reconciliation is served at
  `/api/v1/breakglass/reconcile`.
- **Order matters in remediation.** The reissue-before-revoke ordering is deliberate;
  don't shortcut it, or you risk an outage mid-incident.
- **JIT needs real approvers configured** and a notifier wired, or requests will sit in
  `awaiting-approval` until they expire.
- **PAM sessions need configured targets and attestors.** Postgres targets need an
  administrative DSN that can create and drop scoped roles. SSH targets need hosts that
  trust the trstctl SSH CA; trstctl does not weaken host `sshd` trust on your behalf.
- **Break-glass is a last resort.** It trades the control plane's guarantees for offline
  availability; reconcile the bundles promptly so the audit log is complete.

## Reference

- **Compromise:** `/api/v1/incidents/executions`, `incident.execution.recorded`,
  `Workflow.Preview`, `Workflow.Remediate` (replacement→deploy→revoke).
- **Playbooks:** `/api/v1/remediation/playbooks`,
  `/api/v1/remediation/playbooks/{id}/runs`, `remediation.playbook_run.recorded`,
  and `connector.right_size` outbox delivery for right-size; revoke/rotate use the
  lifecycle state machine.
- **ITSM:** `/api/v1/itsm/servicenow/tickets`, `itsm.ticket.requested`,
  `itsm.servicenow` outbox delivery; token material by `token_ref` only.
- **Response integrations:** `/api/v1/incidents/response-integrations/dispatch`,
  `response.integration.dispatched`, and outbox fan-out to `response.splunk`,
  `response.jira`, `notification.response`, and `itsm.servicenow`; token material by
  `token_ref` only.
- **Fleet:** `/api/v1/incidents/fleet-reissuance-runs`,
  `trstctl incidents fleet-reissuance *`,
  `incident.fleet_reissuance.recorded` — staged, health-checked, resumable.
- **JIT:** `RequestIssuance`, `Approve`, `Deny`; default `RequiredApprovals: 2`,
  self-approval blocked.
- **PAM-lite:** `/api/v1/access/sessions`; Postgres scoped login roles; OpenSSH user
  certificates; `pam.session.started`, `pam.session.expired`.
- **Break-glass:** `POST /api/v1/breakglass/issue`, `IssueOffline`,
  `Verify`, `POST /api/v1/breakglass/reconcile`.
- **Events:** `incident.*`, `response.integration.dispatched`, `fleet.*`, `approval.*`, `pam.session.*`,
  `breakglass.issued`.
