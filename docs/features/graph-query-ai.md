# Graph, query & AI — see how everything connects, and ask in plain language

## What it is

trstctl doesn't just hold a flat list of credentials — it builds a **graph** of how they
connect (which workload owns which key, which key was issued by which CA, what each can
reach), exposes a **unified query layer** to ask questions across all its data safely,
and layers **AI** on top: a pluggable model adapter, grounded root-cause analysis with
natural-language questions, and an [MCP](../glossary.md) server so external AI agents can
query trstctl through a safe, read-only interface.

The mental model: the graph is a map of your credential city showing every road between
buildings; the query layer is the one inspector's desk every question must pass through
(so nobody peeks at another tenant's records); and the AI layer is an analyst who answers
your questions **only** from evidence pulled across that desk, always citing sources.

## Why it exists

Security questions are rarely about one credential — they're about *relationships*: "if
this key leaks, what's exposed?", "what does this AI agent actually have access to?", "why
did this renewal fail?". Answering those needs a graph and a way to query it. And because
those queries touch sensitive data across many subsystems, they need **one** rigorously
scoped path rather than each feature reinventing access control. The AI layer then makes
the whole thing approachable — ask in English, get a cited answer — without ever letting a
model invent facts or leak across tenants.

## How it works

### The credential graph (F21)

The graph models your inventory as **nodes** (workloads, credentials, issuers, resources,
crypto assets, attestations) and **impact-oriented edges** (`ISSUED`, `OWNS`,
`DEPLOYED_TO`, `GRANTS_ACCESS`, `CONNECTS_TO`, `EXHIBITS`) where an edge `A→B` means
"compromising A puts B at risk." It's built on demand from the store, every read scoped by
tenant (**AN-1**), so a traversal can never escape the tenant boundary. On top of it:
`Reachable` (breadth-first reach), `BlastRadius` (everything a compromise touches, grouped
by kind), and a deliberately minimal Cypher-style `Query`.

*Code:* `internal/graph` (`Build`, `Reachable`, `BlastRadius`, `Query`). **Served** —
`GET /api/v1/graph`, `/graph/reachable/{id}`, `/graph/blast-radius/{id}`,
`POST /api/v1/graph/query`, plus the `graph` CLI group.

### The unified semantic query layer (F75)

This is the **one security boundary** every advanced consumer (AI, MCP, compliance) routes
through, so scoping is never reinvented. Callers submit a *typed* `Spec` — allow-listed
surfaces (log, graph, inventory, owners, CBOM), allow-listed fields and operators, bound
values — and **never raw SQL or Cypher**. The engine enforces, *by construction*:
**tenant first** (the tenant is always the caller's, non-overridable, RLS underneath —
**AN-1**), then **RBAC** (you must hold the permission for *every* selected surface, or the
whole query is denied before execution — not post-filtered). It runs on a
[bulkhead](../glossary.md) with a wall-clock deadline and row caps (**AN-7**), pins results
to an event-log offset for consistency (**AN-2**), and returns deliberately coarse errors
so a caller can't tell "out of scope" from "not found."

*Code:* `internal/query` (`Engine`, `Spec`, `Surface`, `Predicate`),
`internal/api`, `internal/server`. **Served through the read-only AI/RCA routes when
`ai.enable_api` is on** (`POST /api/v1/ai/query`, `POST /api/v1/ai/rca`) and used by the
read-only MCP tools. The standalone Go API remains available for embedded consumers.

### The pluggable AI model adapter (F76)

trstctl's AI features are model-agnostic: a thin adapter routes reasoning to either a
cloud LLM or a **local** Ollama/vLLM endpoint by config, for air-gapped or
data-sovereign deployments. Critically, a **redactor** runs before any prompt leaves the
process — stripping PEM blocks, secret/token assignments, and long base64 runs (**AN-8**)
— so key material cannot reach a model or its logs. If no model is configured, the served
AI surface still returns grounded evidence/citations without model egress. *Code:*
`internal/aimodel` (`Adapter`, `DefaultRedactor`, `CloudModel`, `LocalModel`). **Served
as an optional adapter behind `ai.enable_api`; no model is configured by default.**

### Grounded RCA & natural-language query (F77)

You ask a question in plain language ("what's the blast radius of the payments cert?");
trstctl **gathers real evidence** through the query layer (inheriting its tenant+RBAC
scoping), then a synthesizer answers using **only** that evidence — every claim carries a
**citation** (`source#id`), and with no evidence it says "insufficient evidence" rather
than inventing an answer. The prompt explicitly treats retrieved data as untrusted (so a
hostile string in a SAN can't become an instruction), the pipeline is strictly
**read-only**, and every gather is audited. *Code:* `internal/rca` (`Pipeline`,
`Synthesizer`). **Served** at `POST /api/v1/ai/rca` when `ai.enable_api` is on.

### The trstctl MCP server (F78)

The [Model Context Protocol](../glossary.md) is how external AI agents call tools.
trstctl's MCP server exposes four **read-only** tools — `query_credentials`,
`get_blast_radius`, `explain_incident`, `compliance_status` — and nothing that writes (it
has no remediation tools). Every call is scoped to one tenant (a cross-tenant call is
refused *before* any query), per-caller rate-limited to resist enumeration, and audited;
answers flow through the grounded RCA pipeline so they're cited and redacted. Fittingly,
the server holds a [workload identity](workload-identity.md) issued by trstctl's own
broker — it dogfoods the platform. *Code:* `internal/mcpserver` (`Server`, `Call`,
`Tools`). **Served** at `GET /api/v1/mcp/tools` and
`POST /api/v1/mcp/tools/{tool}` when `ai.enable_api` is on.

## Use it

The graph is served — explore relationships and blast radius:

```sh
trstctl-cli graph nodes
trstctl-cli graph blast-radius cert:payments-tls
trstctl-cli graph query 'MATCH (w:workload)-[:OWNS]->(c)-[:DEPLOYED_TO]->(r) WHERE w.name = "payments-svc" RETURN c, r.name'
```

Those map to the served `/api/v1/graph*` routes. When `ai.enable_api` is on, grounded
query/RCA and read-only MCP are served too:

```sh
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRSTCTL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"what is the blast radius of the payments cert?"}' \
  https://trstctl.example.com/api/v1/ai/rca

curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRSTCTL_TOKEN" \
  https://trstctl.example.com/api/v1/mcp/tools
```

## Pitfalls & limits

| Capability | Status today |
|---|---|
| Credential graph (F21) | **Served** — `/api/v1/graph*`, `graph` CLI |
| Semantic query layer (F75) | **Served** through `/api/v1/ai/query` and `/api/v1/ai/rca` when `ai.enable_api` is on; Go API also available |
| AI model adapter (F76) | **Optional served adapter**; no model configured by default, cloud/local model egress only when an operator opts in |
| Grounded RCA / NL query (F77) | **Served** — `POST /api/v1/ai/rca`, read-only and cited |
| MCP server (F78) | **Served** — `GET /api/v1/mcp/tools`, `POST /api/v1/mcp/tools/{tool}`, read-only tools only |

Other notes: the graph and query layer are built per request from the store, so very large
tenants pay a build cost (bounded by caps). The AI features are **grounded and read-only by
design** — they won't take actions and won't answer beyond the evidence. With no model
configured, RCA returns the raw evidence listing rather than a prose answer. See
[Current limitations](../limitations.md).

## Reference

- **Graph (served):** `GET /api/v1/graph`, `/graph/reachable/{id}`,
  `/graph/blast-radius/{id}`, `POST /api/v1/graph/query`; CLI `graph`.
- **Node kinds:** workload, credential, issuer, resource, crypto-asset, attestation.
- **Query surfaces:** log, graph, certificates, owners, CBOM (tenant-then-RBAC,
  allow-listed fields/operators, no raw SQL/Cypher).
- **AI:** model adapter (cloud or local Ollama/vLLM) with boundary redaction; RCA returns
  cited answers; MCP tools are read-only and rate-limited.
