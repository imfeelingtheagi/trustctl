# Enrollment protocols — how existing devices ask for certificates

## What it is

"Enrollment" is the moment a device asks a [CA](../glossary.md) for a
[certificate](../glossary.md) and gets one back. [ACME](acme-and-dns.md) is the modern
way, but the world is full of routers, switches, printers, phones, factory controllers,
and 5G base stations that already speak *older* enrollment protocols baked into their
firmware. trstctl serves those protocols too — [EST](../glossary.md),
[SCEP](../glossary.md), and [CMP](../glossary.md) — plus a tiny enrollment client for
constrained IoT devices and an integration so mobile-device-management (MDM) platforms
can enroll managed phones and laptops.

The point: you should not have to re-flash a million devices to bring them under
trstctl. If a device can already enroll over EST, SCEP, or CMP, it can enroll against
trstctl unchanged.

## Why it exists

Every certificate eventually expires, so every device needs a *repeatable* way to get a
fresh one without a human visiting it. Different industries standardized on different
protocols years ago: enterprise and IoT gear tend to speak EST (RFC 7030); network
hardware and mobile-device management speak SCEP (RFC 8894); telecom and industrial
systems speak CMP (RFC 4210). Supporting all three means trstctl can become the issuing
authority for an existing fleet on day one, instead of being limited to greenfield
ACME-aware workloads.

## How it works

All three protocol servers share the same trstctl spine. Each one parses its protocol's
request format inside the single isolated cryptography path, authenticates the caller,
then hands the [CSR](../glossary.md) to the *same* issuance path every other feature uses
— with an `Idempotency-Key` so a retry never mints twice, the [outbox](../glossary.md)
that journals outbound calls and delivers them at-least-once, and an immutable audit event
for every allow/deny/shed decision. Each runs in its own bounded [lane](../glossary.md)
and sheds load with HTTP 503 when saturated, so an enrollment storm can't starve the rest
of the system.

### EST (F22) — the modern enrollment protocol

EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport, RFC 7030) is a small set of HTTPS endpoints. A
client fetches the CA chain from `/cacerts` (no auth, so it can bootstrap trust), then
POSTs a CSR to `/simpleenroll` (first time) or `/simplereenroll` (renewal) and gets back
a PKCS#7-wrapped certificate. trstctl implements all four endpoints (including
`/csrattrs`), authenticates via an injected authenticator, caps request bodies, verifies
the CSR's self-signature through the single isolated cryptography path, and honors an
`Idempotency-Key` header (or derives one from the CSR) so a retried enroll never mints
twice.

Routes under `/.well-known/est/...`.

EST also serves the C3 parity extensions. EST `/serverkeygen` is available when a
profile opts in: the signer generates the key, the response returns the issued
certificate plus encrypted private key material as CMS EnvelopedData, and the raw key
does not enter logs or audit events. RFC 9266 channel binding is supported with
`tls-server-end-point`, so a CSR can be bound to the server TLS certificate and a relayed
enrollment fails closed. Operators can split profiles by per-profile PathID under
`/.well-known/est/<PathID>/...`; a separate mTLS sibling route lives under
`/.well-known/est-mtls/<PathID>/...` for 802.1X/Wi-Fi bootstrap flows. EST also has
per-IP and per-principal enrollment rate limits.

### SCEP (F23) — the one network and MDM gear still speaks

SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol, RFC 8894) is ancient but ubiquitous in
routers, printers, and mobile-device management. It wraps requests in CMS (signed,
encrypted ASN.1 envelopes). trstctl advertises its capabilities at `GetCACaps`, returns
the chain at `GetCACert`, and on `PKIOperation` decrypts the CMS envelope and extracts
the CSR — all CMS handling inside the single isolated cryptography path. The SCEP
transaction ID becomes the idempotency key. Notably, the SCEP **RA transport key** is
deliberately separate from the platform CA signing key and never enters the isolated
signing service. It is sealed at rest under `protocols.ra_key_file` and shared across
replicas, so a device that cached `GetCACert` material can still complete enrollment after
a restart or rolling deploy.

SCEP has per-profile SCEP RA material: different profiles can present distinct RA
certificates and keys, while still using the same platform issuance path behind the
protocol. A per-device rate limiter caps repeated enrollment attempts from the same
device identity, and the challenge hook can require an MDM-issued challenge before any
CSR is signed.

Routes `/scep`, `/scep/pkiclient.exe`.

### CMP (F55) — for telecom and industrial PKI

CMP (Certificate Management Protocol, RFC 4210, over HTTP per RFC 6712) is common in 5G
and industrial systems. trstctl serves the `p10cr` flow: it reads the DER PKIMessage,
extracts the transaction ID and CSR through the single isolated cryptography path, issues,
and returns a signed `pkixcmp` response. As with SCEP, the CMP protection key is the
sealed `protocols.ra_key_file` transport identity, distinct from the CA key held in the
isolated signing service.

Route `POST /cmp`.

### The embedded / IoT enrollment agent (F54)

The smallest devices can't run a Go agent, so trstctl ships two cooperating pieces. On
the control-plane side, an **enrollment authority** issues single-use *bootstrap tokens*
and signs the device's first [mTLS](../glossary.md) certificate; the device generates its
own key, keeps the private half forever (it never crosses the wire), and sends only a
CSR. On the device side there's a **POSIX C client** (`est_client.c`) that depends only
on libc and the `openssl` CLI — small enough for constrained hardware — and the test
suite actually compiles and runs it against a real EST server. A bootstrap token is
checked-and-deleted atomically, so it works exactly once.

**Status:** the running control plane mounts **`POST /enroll/bootstrap`** and
**`POST /enroll/renewal`**. Bootstrap consumes the one-time token. Renewal accepts only a
verified client certificate from the current agent identity, rejects missing or expired
peer certificates, and signs a fresh CSR without ever receiving the device's private key.
The steady-state agent channel is also served when `agent_channel.enabled`, so larger
agents can renew over mTLS gRPC while embedded clients can use the HTTP renewal surface.

### Intune / MDM enrollment (F56)

When a mobile-device-management platform (Microsoft Intune, JAMF) pushes a SCEP profile
to a managed phone or laptop, you want *only* MDM-provisioned devices to enroll — not
anyone who can reach the SCEP endpoint. trstctl's MDM integration issues a stateless,
HMAC-signed **challenge token** that the MDM embeds in the device's SCEP profile
`challengePassword`. The SCEP server validates the token (constant-time MAC check,
expiry) before issuing — fail-closed on any defect. It's stateless: the HMAC key is the
only shared secret, so there's no database lookup on the hot path. The HMAC key is held in
wipeable `[]byte` memory and zeroed after use, never a copyable string.

For Microsoft Intune, trstctl validates the Intune JWS challenge against policy-backed
trust anchors, checks tenant and CSR subject/SAN binding, and consumes the nonce through
a single-use replay cache for the token TTL. A captured challenge cannot be replayed for
a second enrollment. The gate wires into the served SCEP server's challenge hook.

Operators can now manage MDM SCEP enrollment policy records through the served control
plane: `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/mdm/scep/policies`, `POST
/api/v1/mdm/scep/policies/{id}/rotate-challenge`, `GET /api/v1/mdm/scep/status`, and
the matching `trstctl mdm scep ...` commands. These records keep profile guidance,
challenge mode, reference names for trust anchors, rotation version, and challenge
telemetry visible in API, CLI, and the Protocols UI without storing raw MDM secrets.
At runtime the SCEP validator resolves enabled policy `trust_anchor_refs` from the
served secret store (`secret://...`) for each challenge decision, so trust-anchor
changes take effect without rebuilding or restarting the protocol handler. The static
`protocols.scep.intune_challenge` anchors remain as a bootstrap/fallback path.

## Use it

A device using a standard EST client enrolls like this (conceptually):

```sh
# 1) fetch the CA chain (no auth) to establish trust
curl -s https://trstctl.example.com/.well-known/est/cacerts -o cacerts.p7

# 2) enroll: POST a base64 PKCS#10 CSR, get back a PKCS#7 cert
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/pkcs10" \
     -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
     --data-binary @request.b64 \
     https://trstctl.example.com/.well-known/est/simpleenroll
```

A constrained IoT device instead bootstraps with a one-time token over the served
endpoint:

```sh
curl -s -X POST https://trstctl.example.com/enroll/bootstrap \
     -d '{"token":"<one-time-token>","csr":"<base64-DER-CSR>"}'
# -> {"certificate":"<PEM chain>"}
```

## Pitfalls & limits

Be precise about what's mounted in the running server today:

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Embedded bootstrap (`POST /enroll/bootstrap`, F54) | **Served** by the control plane |
| Embedded renewal (`POST /enroll/renewal`, F54) | **Served** by the control plane; requires the current verified client certificate and rejects missing or expired peers |
| EST server (F22) | **Served** at `/.well-known/est/...` (`protocols.est.enabled` + `protocols.est.tenant_id`) — Bearer-token + TLS auth, orchestrator-backed, tenant-scoped |
| EST serverkeygen / channel binding / profile routes | **Served when configured** — `/serverkeygen`, RFC 9266 `tls-server-end-point`, per-profile PathID, and the mTLS sibling route |
| SCEP server (F23) | **Served** at `/scep` (`protocols.scep.enabled` + `protocols.scep.tenant_id`) — CMS transport, orchestrator-backed, tenant-scoped |
| SCEP per-profile RA and rate limits | **Served when configured** — per-profile SCEP RA cert/key plus per-device rate limiter |
| CMP server (F55) | **Served** at `/cmp` (`protocols.cmp.enabled` + `protocols.cmp.tenant_id`) — orchestrator-backed, tenant-scoped |
| MDM challenge (F56) | **Served** — API/CLI/UI policy management, challenge rotation evidence, profile guidance, challenge telemetry, Intune JWS validation, tenant/CSR binding, single-use replay cache, and live SCEP validator trust-anchor resolution from policy `trust_anchor_refs` backed by the served secret store |

The protocol servers each expose a `Handler()` and are mounted on the control-plane
TLS listener at startup, each behind the same issuance seam the API mint uses —
backed by the isolated signing service, scoped to one tenant, event-sourced, idempotent,
and profile-gated. Each is gated by `protocols.<name>.enabled` and binds a tenant via
`protocols.<name>.tenant_id`; all protocol toggles default off until an operator supplies
that tenant binding, and validation fails at startup when an enabled protocol has no
tenant — so a server can never come up serving an unscoped, cross-tenant path. They
activate only when an issuing CA is provisioned. Other notes: EST and SCEP
both rely on the device trusting the `/cacerts`/`GetCACert` chain first; SCEP's
security depends on the challenge gate (F56) since the protocol itself is weakly
authenticated. For SCEP/CMP, keep `protocols.ra_key_file` on shared persistent storage
in HA so all replicas use the same CMS transport identity.
