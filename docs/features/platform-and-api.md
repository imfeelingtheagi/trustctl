# Platform & API — how you drive trstctl, and how it runs

## What it is

This page covers the "platform plumbing" — the surfaces you use to operate trstctl and
the properties of how it runs: the **REST API**, the **CLI**, the **web UI**, **OIDC
single sign-on**, **single-binary distribution**, **encrypted transport**, **multi-tenant
topology**, and **federation**. These aren't glamorous features, but they're what make
trstctl usable, secure, and operable in a real organization.

The mental model: if the [feature pages](../features.md) are the appliances, this is the
wiring, the breaker box, the front door lock, and the meter — the infrastructure that lets
everything else run safely on shared premises.

## Why it exists

A control plane is only as good as how you interact with it and how safely it runs. You
need a programmable API for automation, a CLI for scripts and CI, a UI for humans, SSO so
people log in with existing accounts, encrypted channels so nothing is sniffable, hard
tenant isolation so customers can't see each other, and a distribution simple enough to
actually deploy. These are the table-stakes properties an enterprise checks before it
trusts a platform with its credentials.

## How it works

### The REST API (F10)

The API is **data-driven**: every route is declared once in a single registry that
simultaneously generates the served `http.ServeMux`, the **OpenAPI 3.1** document (served
at `/api/v1/openapi.json`), and the CLI command table — so the spec, the server, and the
CLI can't drift apart. Errors are RFC 7807 `application/problem+json`. Every mutation
requires an [`Idempotency-Key`](../glossary.md) (**AN-5**) recorded in PostgreSQL so a
retry returns the original result. Tenant comes from the authenticated principal
(**AN-1**), pagination uses opaque cursors, and over-budget callers get `429` with
`Retry-After`. *Code:* `internal/api` (`routes()`, `guard`, `mutate`). **Served.**

### The CLI (F11)

`trstctl-cli` is the API's twin: every command is a row in a table that maps
`trstctl-cli <group> <verb>` straight to an API route, so the CLI is provably at parity
with the API and carries no bespoke logic. It auto-supplies idempotency keys on mutations.
Command groups: `owners`, `issuers`, `identities`, `certificates`, `profiles`, `audit`,
`graph`, `risk`, `agents`. *Code:* `internal/cli`, `cmd/trstctl-cli`. **Served (binary).**

### The web UI (F12)

The UI is a React 18 + Vite + shadcn/ui single-page app **served by the binary** from
an embedded filesystem on the same port and TLS certificate as the API. Real hashed
asset files are served directly, deep links fall back to the SPA, and `/api/*` stays
owned by the API handler. No separate static server is required. *Code:* `internal/webui`,
`internal/webui/dist`, `web/`. **Served.** The embedded `index.html` references the real
Vite bundle, and tests fail if a clean build regresses to the placeholder.

### OIDC single sign-on (F13)

People log in through **OIDC** (OpenID Connect) against any standards-compliant provider.
The authorization-code flow uses random `state` (CSRF protection) and a mandatory `nonce`
(replay protection); the returned id_token is verified — signature (via JWKS through
`internal/crypto/jose`, **AN-3**), issuer, audience, expiry, nonce — and on success
trstctl mints a short-lived, HMAC-signed, `HttpOnly`+`Secure` session cookie. That
session resolves to an [RBAC](policy-and-governance.md) principal, so a browser login
authorizes API calls. CI/CD instead uses API tokens (`trst_`-prefixed, only the SHA-256 hash
stored). *Code:* `internal/auth`, `internal/api/auth.go`, `internal/server`. **Served
when `auth.oidc.enabled` is configured.** API tokens remain the default auth path when
OIDC is disabled; an enabled-but-incomplete OIDC block fails closed at startup.

### Single-binary distribution (F14)

For evaluation, the one `trstctl` binary **embeds and supervises its own datastores**:
a bundled PostgreSQL (downloaded once, checksum-pinned, run on loopback) and an embedded,
file-backed NATS JetStream — zero external dependencies to try it. Even bundled, Postgres
runs under the non-superuser `trstctl_app` role so row-level security still applies
(**AN-1** isn't relaxed for eval). The [signing service](../design/signing-service.md) is
*always* a separate supervised child process, never in-process (**AN-4**). For production,
flip Postgres/NATS to external. *Code:* `cmd/trstctl`, `internal/server`, `internal/dist`.
**Served (binary).**

### Encrypted control-plane transport (F15)

Every channel is encrypted. By default the signing service is reached over a **Unix
domain socket with `SO_PEERCRED`** peer-uid authentication (a 0600 socket; a different
uid is rejected); across nodes it is reached over **mTLS** (TLS 1.3, AEAD-only, the
control plane and signer each pinning the other's certificate — SIGNER-005). Either
way it has no HTTP server and no SQL driver (**AN-4**), and at startup it disables
core dumps and ptrace (**AN-8**). The REST API/UI is served over **TLS** (self-signed by
default for instant start, operator cert in production, TLS 1.3, AEAD-only). Agents connect
over **[mTLS](../glossary.md)** with short-lived, auto-rotated client certificates. All
TLS/x509 code lives only in `internal/crypto/mtls` (**AN-3**). *Code:* `internal/signing`,
`internal/crypto/mtls`, `internal/server/serve.go`. **Served.**

> Note: the default signer channel is a peer-authenticated UDS (co-located/sidecar);
> the cross-node channel is mutually-authenticated, mutually-pinned mTLS (SIGNER-005).

### Multi-tenant topology (F40)

Isolation between tenants is enforced **by PostgreSQL itself**, not by application code
(**AN-1**). Every table carries a `tenant_id` and has [row-level security](../glossary.md)
that denies all rows when the tenant context is unset (fail-closed). `WithTenant` drops to
the non-superuser role and sets the tenant for the transaction, so every query is confined
automatically — and a custom build linter *fails the build* if any repository query omits
the tenant filter. A single-company deployment simply runs one tenant. *Code:*
`internal/store` (`WithTenant`, RLS migrations), `tools/trstctllint/tenantfilter`.

### Federation (F41)

Cross-cluster / multi-region **federation** — replicating the event log across regions,
placing credentials by residency, and replicating audit across regions — is **planned, not
yet built**. There is no federation code in the platform today; the design is scoped for a
future sprint (S21.2), and when built it will rest on the same `tenant_id` (**AN-1**) and
event-log-replication (**AN-2**) foundations. We document it here, honestly, as roadmap
rather than a shipped capability. See [Current limitations](../limitations.md).

## Use it

```sh
# the API spec (no auth needed) — point your tooling at it
curl -s https://trstctl.example.com/api/v1/openapi.json

# drive it from the CLI
trstctl-cli certificates list --limit 50
trstctl-cli audit events --type cert.issued --since 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z

# one-binary evaluation: bundled datastores, supervised signer
TRSTCTL_POSTGRES_MODE=bundled TRSTCTL_NATS_MODE=embedded ./trstctl
```

The web console, browser `/auth/login` flow, REST API, and CLI all drive the same
served control plane. API tokens are still the zero-dependency bootstrap path; OIDC
turns on only when configured. See [Current limitations](../limitations.md),
[Install](../install.md), and [Configuration](../configuration.md) for production setup.

## Pitfalls & limits

- **Federation (F41) is roadmap, not shipped** — don't design a multi-region topology
  around it yet.
- **TLS defaults to self-signed** for instant start; set an operator cert
  (`TRSTCTL_SERVER_TLS_MODE=file`) for production, and never use `disabled` outside local
  dev.
- **Bundled datastores are for evaluation**; run external PostgreSQL and NATS in
  production.
- **The signer is a separate process by design** — don't try to collapse it in; that
  isolation (AN-4) is a security boundary.

## Reference

- **API:** OpenAPI 3.1 at `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`; RFC 7807 errors; `Idempotency-Key`
  on mutations; cursor pagination; `429` + `Retry-After`.
- **CLI groups:** `owners`, `issuers`, `identities`, `certificates`, `profiles`, `audit`,
  `graph`, `risk`, `agents`.
- **Auth:** `/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/logout` (OIDC when
  `auth.oidc.enabled` is on); API tokens prefixed `trst_`. Config:
  `TRSTCTL_AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER`, `TRSTCTL_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`,
  `TRSTCTL_AUTH_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`.
- **Run modes:** `TRSTCTL_POSTGRES_MODE` (`bundled`/`external`), `TRSTCTL_NATS_MODE`
  (`embedded`/`external`), `TRSTCTL_SERVER_TLS_MODE` (`internal`/`file`/`disabled`).
- **Federation (F41):** planned (S21.2), not implemented.
