# Current limitations & what's not yet served

trustctl is pre-1.0 and under active hardening. This page is the honest companion
to the capability list: it states plainly **what the running binary serves today**
versus **what is built and tested as library code but not yet wired into the
served product**, and which surfaces are explicitly Phase 2. Nothing here is
feature-gated — "open edition" and "commercial" run the same code; these are
maturity boundaries, not paywalls.

If a capability matters to your evaluation, check this page before relying on it.

## Served by the running binary today

`cmd/trustctl` assembles and serves a control plane: the event log, projections,
orchestrator, and REST API, with the signing service supervised as a separate
out-of-process child (AN-4). What you can do end to end against the running binary:

- **Inventory and lifecycle** for owners, issuers, identities, and certificates —
  create, read, list (keyset-paginated), and drive the lifecycle state machine.
- **Real X.509 issuance**: transitioning an identity to *issued* mints a leaf
  certificate from the assembled CA (its key held in the out-of-process signer) and
  records it in inventory. This is exercised end to end in CI.
- **Authentication and RBAC** via **scoped API tokens** (sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer`), **multi-tenancy** with PostgreSQL row-level security,
  and a **tamper-evident audit chain**. A fresh boot fails closed (every route
  `401`s until a credential exists); mint the first tenant-scoped token on the host
  with `trustctl token create --tenant <uuid>` (it writes through the store and
  prints the token once). Interactive **OIDC SSO login is served by the binary**
  when `auth.oidc.enabled` is set (see "Single sign-on" below): the browser
  authorization-code flow mints an `HttpOnly` session cookie that authorizes API
  calls under the **same RBAC + per-tenant RLS scoping** as an API token, and each
  user is mapped to its real tenant (`EXC-WIRE-01`). API-token auth remains the
  default when OIDC is disabled.
- **Transport security** (TLS, internal or file-based), **idempotency** and the
  **outbox**, **observability** (`/metrics`, `/readyz`, W3C trace headers),
  **bulkheads + per-tenant rate limiting**, **backup/restore + disaster recovery**,
  and **safe schema migrations**.

The `trustctl-cli` drives this same served surface. **Interactive OIDC browser
login + sessions are served by the binary** (`EXC-WIRE-01`, behind
`auth.oidc.enabled`) — see "Single sign-on" below. The **React web console is now
shipped in the binary** (`EXC-WIRE-04`): a clean `go build ./cmd/trustctl` embeds the
real built Vite bundle and serves it at `/`, and the frontend's API types are
**generated from the served OpenAPI contract** so they cannot silently drift
(SURFACE-001/005). The remaining tail of `EXC-WIRE-04` is the **AI/RCA/MCP** surface,
which is still library-only and honestly disclosed below.

## Built and tested, but not yet served by the binary

These subsystems exist as **library code with real unit/integration/conformance
tests**, but are **not yet wired into the served API of the running binary**. They
are usable from Go today; "served, authenticated, end-to-end in the binary" is the
remaining integration work.

- **CA integrations** (9 under `internal/ca/`) and the **private CA hierarchy**
  (root/intermediate, cross-sign, rotation, and the m-of-n key ceremony — see the
  [key-ceremony runbook](runbooks/key-ceremony.md)).
- **Deployment connectors** (**13** under `internal/connector/`: nginx, Apache,
  IIS, HAProxy, F5, NetScaler, plus the network-appliance set Cisco, FortiGate, and
  Palo Alto, plus AWS ACM, Azure Key Vault, GCP Certificate Manager, and Java
  keystore — plus the Kubernetes destination). The lifecycle's `connector.deploy`
  step is acknowledged by the outbox but not yet routed to these in the served path.
- **Discovery**: network/filesystem scans, SSH key & trust inventory, agentless
  cloud-certificate enumeration, the **CBOM** with post-quantum posture, and
  **Certificate Transparency** monitoring.
- **SSH trust *rewrite* (the privileged `authorized_keys`/CA-trust mutator,
  `internal/agent/sshtrust`)**: the applier that installs a trusted SSH CA and
  rolls it back on failure is now **wired into `cmd/trustctl-agent`** behind a
  **default-off operator opt-in** (`--ssh-trust-add-ca`) that additionally requires
  **explicit confirmation** (`--ssh-trust-confirm`) before it will rewrite trust
  (SIGNER-004, EXC-WIRE-05). The op is **additive** (it never removes existing
  trust), validates the new config with `sshd -t`, reloads, and **auto-rolls-back**
  to the last-known-good on any failure — so a bad rewrite cannot lock operators
  out. Because weakening `sshd`/`authorized_keys` trust is a high-blast-radius
  mutation, the feature stays off unless the operator turns it on and confirms;
  with the flag off the agent only *discovers* SSH trust (inventory, above), it
  does not *mutate* it. Trust *removal* still requires its own explicit confirmation
  (the safe default, SIGNER-007).
- **Posture**: the **credential graph** (reachability, blast radius), **composite
  risk scoring**, and **drift detection**.
- **The React web console (F12) — now served (see "The React web console" below).**
  The console moved out of this list: a clean `go build` embeds the real Vite bundle
  and serves it (`EXC-WIRE-04`/SURFACE-001). What remains *not yet served* of the
  original F12 epic is the **AI/RCA/MCP** surface (below) and two SPA scale items
  (cursor pagination, list virtualization, SURFACE-007).
## The React web console: served by the binary

As of **`EXC-WIRE-04`** the React 18 + Vite + shadcn/ui single-page app (F12) is the
**real embedded artifact the running binary serves**, closing SURFACE-001/005/006:

- **The shipped binary serves the real console.** `make web` (run in CI and the
  release pipeline) builds the SPA into `internal/webui/dist`, which the binary embeds
  via `//go:embed`; the built bundle is committed, so even a plain
  `go build ./cmd/trustctl` (no `make web` step) serves the real console at `/` —
  hashed `/assets/index-*.{js,css}` and an `index.html` that references them — not the
  old "not built" placeholder. A Go test boots the served handler over the real embed
  and fails if it ever regresses to the placeholder
  (`internal/webui` `TestServedRootIsTheRealConsoleNotThePlaceholder`,
  `TestServedHashedAssetsResolve`); the release gate `TestEmbeddedUIIsARealBuild`
  (set `TRUSTCTL_REQUIRE_BUILT_UI=1`, run by `make web` and the release job) blocks a
  release that would embed the placeholder.
- **Generated FE↔BE contract (SURFACE-005).** The frontend's API types are **generated
  from the served OpenAPI contract**, not hand-duplicated: `web/scripts/gen-api-types.mjs`
  emits `web/src/lib/api-types.gen.ts` from the spec golden
  (`internal/api/testdata/openapi.golden.json`, pinned == the live served spec by
  `TestOpenAPIGolden`), and `web/src/lib/api.ts` re-exports those types so a backend
  field add/rename/remove that is not regenerated fails `tsc`. A CI regenerate-and-diff
  gate (`npm run gen:api -- --check`, plus the Go `TestGeneratedFETypesMatchServedContract`
  and the Vitest `contract.test.ts`) fails the build on drift — the `certificate.status`
  drift the audit caught can no longer recur silently.
- **Console UX hardening (SURFACE-007).** A **destructive-transition confirmation**
  (revoke/retire require an explicit, credential-named confirm dialog) and
  **429/`Retry-After` handling** (the API client surfaces a concrete "retry in Ns"
  hint) are served and tested (`web/src/lib/api.test.ts`,
  `web/src/__tests__/lifecycle.test.tsx`). Still outstanding in the SPA:
  **cursor-based pagination** (the client reads only `.items` and ignores
  `next_cursor`) and **list virtualization** for large tables; both remain tracked
  under **`EXC-WIRE-04`**.

## Interactive OIDC browser login & sessions: served by the binary

As of **`EXC-WIRE-01`** the OIDC authorization-code login + sessions are **served by
the running binary** (behind `auth.oidc.enabled`), closing SEC-001/WIRE-001/
SURFACE-002. The composition wires `api.WithAuth` from `cmd/trustctl` →
`internal/server` (`server.Build`), so the served control plane mounts the `/auth/*`
routes (the IdP redirect, the callback, the current-principal endpoint, and logout).
The callback verifies the id_token's **signature, issuer, audience, nonce, and
temporal claims (exp/nbf/iat)** through the AN-3 JOSE boundary (`internal/auth`),
then sets an **`HttpOnly` + `SameSite=Strict` session cookie** (marked `Secure`
whenever the control plane serves TLS) plus a **double-submit CSRF token** (SEC-007).
A session cookie authorizes API calls under the **same RBAC + per-tenant RLS
scoping** as an API token; mutations on the cookie path require the CSRF header. When
`auth.oidc.enabled` is false the binary authenticates with scoped API tokens only,
exactly as before; an enabled-but-misconfigured block **fails closed at startup**.

- **Per-user → tenant mapping is served (TENANT-004 — now served).** Each
  authenticated user is mapped to its **real tenant** at session issue — by a
  configurable id_token claim (`auth.oidc.tenant_claim`, optionally used directly as
  the tenant id), by an IdP-group → tenant table, or by an explicit
  subject/claim/group → tenant mapping (`auth.oidc.tenant_mappings`) — instead of
  collapsing every browser user to one tenant. A user that maps to **no tenant is
  rejected** (the login fails closed, never minting a session in a fallback tenant
  unless an operator explicitly opts into `allow_default_tenant`). PostgreSQL RLS
  then confines each session to its mapped tenant (AN-1), so two OIDC users in
  different tenants see only their own data via the served API. The legacy single
  `DefaultTenant` is retained only as that opt-in fallback. This is the served half
  of the RED-004 defense for tenant isolation; a freshly logged-in user still cannot
  self-issue (issuance stays behind the `EXC-WIRE-03` RA/policy gate and the
  requester scope excludes `certs:issue`).
- **The AI surface — model adapter (F76), grounded RCA / NL query (F77), and the
  MCP server (F78)**: these are real, tested **library** code (model-agnostic
  cloud/local adapter with a boundary redactor, grounded read-only RCA with
  citations, a read-only tenant-scoped MCP tool server). None is mounted in the
  served binary — there is **no served, authenticated AI/RCA/MCP endpoint today** —
  and the default is **no model** (AI is off unless one is configured). They are
  **built and tested, not yet served by the binary**; serving an authenticated,
  RBAC-guarded, tenant-scoped surface is the **remaining tail of `EXC-WIRE-04`** (its
  console half is now served — see "The React web console" above). The boundary
  redactor strips key/secret material before any prompt reaches a model (AN-8), so
  even when wired, secret material does not egress. **SURFACE-003 status: honestly
  disclosed, not served** — wiring it was out of scope for the console pass and
  remains tracked here rather than over-claimed.
- **The secrets/identity frameworks — the workload auth-method framework
  (`internal/authmethod`, F58), secret-sync to external stores
  (`internal/secretsync`, F60), the application secrets SDK (`internal/secretsdk`,
  F64), PKI-as-a-secret / dynamic certificate leasing (`internal/pkisecret`, F67),
  and secret sharing (`internal/secretshare`, F68)**: these are real, tested
  **library** code today. Each has **zero importers on the served path** — the
  running binary does not mount a secrets/identity API, so there is **no served,
  authenticated login/secrets endpoint for these five frameworks today**. They are
  **built and tested, not yet served by the binary**; wiring them into an
  authenticated, tenant-scoped served surface is tracked as **`EXC-WIRE-03`**.
  Library credentials are held as `[]byte` and never logged (AN-8); sessions and
  dynamic-secret revocations are event-sourced (AN-2); methods and providers are
  tenant-scoped (AN-1).

## Authorization policy gates: served on the issue/deploy/revoke path

As of **`EXC-WIRE-03`** the OPA/Rego default-deny policy gate, the RA scope split,
and dual-control approval are **enforced on the served mutating issuance path** of
the running binary — not just in library code. They gate the served lifecycle
transition (`POST /api/v1/identities/{id}/transitions`) for issue, deploy, and
revoke, fail-closed, before the orchestrator records the transition or enqueues the
mint/revoke effect. The gate is wired from `cmd/trustctl` → `internal/server`
(`server.Build` → `api.WithMutationGate`/`api.WithApprovals`), and is tenant-scoped
(AN-1), audited (AN-2), and runs the policy engine on its own bulkhead (AN-7).

- **Registration-authority (RA) separation & dual-control approval (SEC-002 — now
  served).** The served gate enforces the RA scope split: a privileged issue/revoke
  transition requires the `certs:issue` authority, so a `certs:request`-only
  requester (the `ra-officer`) **cannot self-issue** on the served path. When dual
  control is enabled (`ca.policy.require_approval`), a privileged action is denied
  until a **distinct** approver records an approval via
  `POST /api/v1/identities/{id}/approvals` (which itself requires `certs:issue`); a
  **self-approval is rejected** (the requester cannot approve their own request),
  backed by the RLS-isolated `issuance_approval_requests` / `issuance_approvals`
  tables. This is the served half of the RED-004 "loaded gun" defense (the bootstrap
  token already withholds `certs:issue`; the served mint now enforces the RA split +
  dual control too). The `internal/approval` package's full request→approve→issue
  state machine (notifications, time-bounded grants, JIT) remains the richer library
  model; the served gate enforces the core distinct-approver / no-self-issue invariant.
- **OPA/Rego policy gate — default-deny on issue/deploy/revoke (SEC-005 — now
  served).** With `ca.policy.enabled` set, the served binary invokes the policy
  engine (`internal/policy`) on every issue/deploy/revoke transition: the request is
  **denied unless the deployed Rego policy explicitly allows it** (default-deny,
  fail-closed). The policy input carries the action, `tenant_id`, the actor
  (authenticated principal), and the bound profile name, so an operator can enforce a
  real Rego document at runtime. A non-compiling policy module is a hard startup
  error, an evaluation error denies, and a saturated policy pool sheds with a 503
  (never an allow). The built-in base policy is default-deny, permits revocation, and
  requires a bound certificate profile to issue/deploy (composing with PKIGOV-002).
  Enforcement is **off by default** (`ca.policy.enabled=false`) so an in-place
  upgrade does not silently start denying; the RA scope split is enforced for
  privileged transitions regardless of this flag.

**Served-leaf profile enforcement (CORRECT-003 / PKIGOV-002).** Independently of the
policy flag, when a default certificate profile is bound (`ca.default_profile`) the
served mint validates the request against the active profile version and rejects an
out-of-profile request before signing (an `issuance.profile_evaluated` deny event) —
so the served mint is profile-gated, not ungated.

## Plugin isolation: first-party in-process, third-party sandboxed

This is a deliberate, documented trust boundary (not an accident):

- **Shipped first-party CA and connector integrations run as trusted in-process
  Go code** — they are *not* sandboxed through the WASM host. Their **blast radius**
  if one is defective is the control plane's address space: the DB connection pool
  (RLS-scoped) and the signer *client* handle (it can request signatures), but
  **not** the CA private key, which stays in the separate signer process (AN-4).
  They are mitigated by code review, the conformance suite, the connector SDK's
  capability-scoped `Sandbox` facade, and AN-7 bulkheads.
- **The WASM plugin host (`internal/pluginhost`, wazero) is real and is the
  isolation boundary for third-party plugins.** A loaded plugin has no ambient
  capabilities and only the host functions its grant permits; the host holds no DB
  pool or signer handle; and a deliberately misbehaving plugin is **proven
  contained** by test. Migrating the first-party integrations onto it is future
  work. See the [plugin trust model](security/threat-model.md).
- **Plugin extensibility is now served by the binary (ARCH-007, EXC-WIRE-05).**
  The WASM plugin host is **wired into the served control plane**: `internal/server`
  imports `internal/pluginhost`, and when `plugins.enabled` the running binary loads
  operator-supplied **connector plugins** from `plugins.dir` and routes a served
  `connector.deploy` through the plugin's **capability sandbox** (the same
  `pluginhost.Grant` model the connector SDK uses) — tenant-scoped (AN-1),
  event-sourced (AN-2), on the plugin bulkhead (AN-7). The plugin runs in its own
  wazero runtime with **no DB pool or signer handle**, an operation outside its
  grant is denied at runtime (and fails the deploy), and the surface is **off by
  default** (a `connector.deploy` is acknowledged unrouted unless plugins are
  enabled). The shipped first-party CA/connector integrations still run as trusted
  in-process Go (see above); migrating them onto the host, and serving a **CA-via-
  plugin** issuance path, remain follow-ups.
- **Served plugins are signature/provenance-verified (SUPPLY-004, EXC-WIRE-05).**
  The served loader admits a `.wasm` module **only after** its detached **Ed25519
  signature** verifies (through the `internal/crypto` boundary, AN-3) against the
  operator-configured **trusted-key set** (`plugins.trusted_key_files`), with an
  optional **content-digest pin** (`plugins.pinned_digests`). An **unsigned**,
  **wrong-key**, **byte-tampered**, or **unpinned** module is **refused** and the
  binary **fails closed at startup** — it never instantiates an unverified plugin.
  The raw `Host.Load` (which `InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasm, …)` calls) remains
  for the in-process/conformance path; the served surface uses `LoadVerified`, which
  runs the provenance gate first and keeps the wazero sandbox as defense-in-depth.

## Protocols

- **ACME** server with **ARI**: all three domain-validation challenges are now
  validated **for real**, each failing closed — **HTTP-01** (RFC 8555 §8.3),
  **DNS-01** (§8.4, the `_acme-challenge` TXT digest), and **TLS-ALPN-01**
  (RFC 8737, the `acme-tls/1` `id-pe-acmeIdentifier` handshake) — behind a
  multiplexer with an automatic method selector (wildcards → DNS-01, no inbound
  `:80` → TLS-ALPN-01, else HTTP-01). The prior accept-everything validator has
  been **removed from the production build** (it survives only in the test
  binary). A DNS-01 solver with a reference provider and conformance harness ships
  for the publish side. A **real RFC 8555 client conformance suite** now exercises
  HTTP-01 end to end (the production validator fetches the published key
  authorization; multi-SAN issuance; a wrong key authorization fails closed), and
  the same protocol-conformance routine runs as a **differential against Pebble**
  (the reference test ACME CA) in CI — so a divergence from the reference surfaces
  as a failure. Still outstanding: real hosted DNS providers (Route53/Cloudflare)
  and the **full cert-manager-in-kind enrollment** (a real in-cluster enrollment in
  CI), tracked for **Epoch 8b**. The ACME server is now **served by the running
  binary** (`EXC-WIRE-02`): it is mounted on the control-plane TLS listener at
  `/directory` + `/acme/...` and brokers issuance through the orchestrator-backed,
  signer-backed (AN-4), tenant-scoped (AN-1), event-sourced (AN-2), idempotent (AN-5),
  profile-gated path. A stock `golang.org/x/crypto/acme` client with an **ECDSA
  account key** drives the served handler end to end (new-account → new-order →
  http-01 → finalize) and downloads a real, signer-issued certificate; a served
  acceptance test asserts the cert verifies and a `certificate.recorded` event exists,
  then revokes via ACME `revokeCert` and asserts the served OCSP responder returns
  *revoked*. The directory advertises the mandatory `revokeCert` and `keyChange`
  resources, and the server accepts ECDSA and Ed25519 account keys (not only RSA).
  Enable/disable it with `protocols.acme.enabled` (default on); it activates only when
  an issuing CA is provisioned (a signer is configured) and fails closed otherwise.
- **EST** (RFC 7030), **SCEP** (RFC 8894), **CMP** (RFC 4210/6712), the **SPIFFE
  Workload API**, and the **SSH CA** issuance servers are **served end-to-end by the
  running binary** (`EXC-WIRE-02`), each behind the same signer-backed, tenant-scoped,
  event-sourced, idempotent, profile-gated issuance seam as the API mint:
  - **EST** at `/.well-known/est/...` (Bearer-API-token authenticated on top of TLS),
    **SCEP** at `/scep`, **CMP** at `/cmp` — mounted on the control-plane mux and
    exercised by served round-trip acceptance tests (a stock base64-PKCS#10 EST
    enroll, a CMS-enveloped SCEP `PKIOperation`, a CMP `p10cr`) that each download a
    real, signer-issued certificate verifying against the served CA and assert a
    `certificate.recorded` event (AN-2). SCEP/CMP use an in-process RSA *transport*
    key for CMS (deliberately **not** the CA key, which stays in the signer — AN-4).
  - the **SPIFFE Workload API** is served as a **gRPC service on a Unix domain
    socket** (`protocols.spiffe.enabled`), so a `spiffe-helper`/go-spiffe/Envoy-SDS
    client dials the socket and `FetchX509SVID` returns an SVID + trust bundle signed
    through the signer; a served acceptance test drives the SPIFFE Workload API wire
    protocol (with the mandatory `workload.spiffe.io` metadata) over the socket and
    validates the SVID. The Workload API protobuf/gRPC contract is vendored verbatim
    from go-spiffe so the wire format is byte-identical (no build-time go-spiffe
    dependency).
  - the **SSH CA** is served at `/ssh/...` (`protocols.ssh.enabled`): cert issuance
    plus the **OpenSSH binary KRL** at `/ssh/krl` (`sshd`'s `RevokedKeys` consumes it
    — INTEROP-009); a served acceptance test issues a user cert (verified with
    `ssh-keygen -L`), revokes it, and confirms the served KRL is the binary format.
    The SSH CA key lives in the signer under its own handle constrained to SSH-cert
    signing (AN-4).

  Each protocol is gated by `protocols.<name>.enabled` (ACME/EST/SCEP/CMP default on;
  SPIFFE and SSH default off — an operator opts those into a deployment) and binds a
  tenant via `protocols.<name>.tenant_id`; a protocol with no configured tenant fails
  closed at issuance (it must not mint into a blank tenant — AN-1). All protocols
  activate only when an issuing CA is provisioned.
  - **Reference-implementation differentials (TEST-002).** Two protocols are
    cross-checked against an *independent* implementation, not just our own parser:
    **ACME** runs a differential against **Pebble** (the reference test ACME CA) as a
    dedicated CI job, and **EST** runs a differential against the **OpenSSL** `pkcs7`
    parser/verifier on every `make test` (so `/cacerts` and `/simpleenroll` output is
    validated by code we did not write). The EST wire framing is *additionally*
    corroborated by an embedded C reference client that enrolls end to end. The
    **SPIFFE Workload API** has a **served round-trip differential**: a real
    Workload-API gRPC client (the go-spiffe-vendored protobuf contract, with the
    mandatory `workload.spiffe.io` metadata) fetches and validates an SVID over the
    served UDS. What is **not yet wired** as a *dedicated CI job*: the **libest**
    `estclient` differential is opt-in/local only (it runs when an operator sets
    `EST_LIBEST`; no workflow ships the binary), and SCEP/CMP have served round-trip
    acceptance tests but no external-reference (sscep / OpenSSL-cmp) differential CI
    job yet — those reference cross-checks are tracked under **`EXC-GATE-01`**.
  - **SSH KRL distribution format (INTEROP-009).** The SSH CA's key-revocation list is
    now emitted in the **OpenSSH binary KRL format** (`KRL.DistributeKRL`), the artifact
    `sshd`'s `RevokedKeys` and `ssh-keygen -Q -f` consume — verified end-to-end by a test
    that has stock `ssh-keygen` report a revoked certificate as revoked using trustctl's
    KRL (and a non-revoked one as valid). The legacy JSON `Snapshot` (`Distribute`) is
    retained for programmatic callers. The SSH CA is now **served** (`EXC-WIRE-02`,
    `protocols.ssh.enabled`): cert issuance at `/ssh/...` and the binary KRL at
    `/ssh/krl`, the artifact a host's `RevokedKeys` consumes.
  - **Public-CA profile linter (PKIGOV-009).** Issued certificates are checked by an
    in-tree **structural RFC 5280 / CA-Browser-Forum profile linter**
    (`internal/ca/profilelint`) in the issuance test suite — version, serial bounds,
    validity ordering/length, basicConstraints, key usage, SAN presence, SKI/AKI
    presence, weak-signature and minimum-key-strength checks — and the suite is **red on
    a deliberately-broken profile**. What is **not yet wired** is an *external* public-CA
    linter (**zlint**/**certlint**) as a dedicated CI gate over a sample of every emitted
    profile; standing that up (vendoring/pinning the tool and running it on issued
    fixtures) is tracked as **`EXC-GATE-01`**.
- **SPIFFE transport (Workload API):** the SVID *document* is spec-shaped (a single
  `spiffe://` URI SAN, correct key usage), and the Workload API is now **served as a
  gRPC service on a Unix domain socket** (`EXC-WIRE-02`, `protocols.spiffe.enabled`),
  so a `spiffe-helper`/go-spiffe/Envoy-SDS workload dials the socket and
  `FetchX509SVID` returns an SVID + trust bundle signed through the signer (AN-4). The
  SVID's workload key is minted server-side and returned in the response (per the
  spec); the X.509-SVID CA is the served issuing CA in the signer and the JWT-SVID
  signing key has its own signer handle. The Workload-API gRPC/protobuf contract is
  vendored verbatim from go-spiffe so the wire format is byte-identical without a
  build-time go-spiffe dependency.
- **Agent ↔ control-plane mTLS gRPC channel (WIRE-004 / OPS-005):** the in-network
  agent's mutual-TLS gRPC transport (`internal/agent/transport`,
  `internal/crypto/mtls`) is built and tested, but it is **library-only and not yet
  served by the binary**: the transport registers **only the standard health
  service** — there are no agent RPCs yet — and **no agent gRPC listener is mounted**
  in `internal/server` (the only served `grpc.Server` is the signer's UDS). So
  although the served `POST /enroll/bootstrap` route mints an **agent mTLS** client
  certificate, there is **no served channel for that agent to connect to** in a real
  deployment. The shipped fleet manifests reflect this gap, not a served port:
  `deploy/kubernetes/daemonset.yaml` points agents at `trustctl.trustctl.svc:9443`
  and the Windows MSI uses `--server …:9443`, but the **control-plane Service exposes
  only the API port `8443`** — there is **no control-plane Service/NetworkPolicy on
  `9443`** (the only `:9443` in the chart belongs to the *isolated signer* topology,
  which is itself not-yet-implemented — see "Multi-replica HA"). So the advertised
  steady-state agent channel (fleet rotation push, drift reporting) is **not
  exposed by the shipped artifacts** (OPS-005). Additionally, the agent CA is
  **in-process and regenerated per boot** today (a deliberate, self-disclosed
  stand-in at `internal/crypto/mtls` — see AN-4): until its key is custodied by the
  signer, an agent's **pinned CA would change on every control-plane restart**.
  Storage multi-tenancy still confines everything (AN-1), so this is a
  **served-vs-library / availability gap, not a tenant leak**. Mounting the agent
  gRPC listener (with the agent RPCs, a control-plane Service + NetworkPolicy on the
  agent port, signer-custodied CA, and cert-derived tenant) is tracked as
  **`EXC-WIRE-02`**.

## Revocation

Revoking a credential through the running binary is **real and recorded**, not a
no-op. Transitioning an identity to *revoked* drives the served outbox handler to:

- mark the issued certificate **revoked in the inventory** — via a projected
  `certificate.revoked` event (AN-2), so the status is reconstructable from the
  log on a `Rebuild()`, and the certificate API now returns `status` /
  `revoked_at` / `revocation_reason` so the revocation is **visible** on the
  served surface (a revoked cert reads `"revoked"`, not silently `"active"`); and
- record the certificate's serial in the **revocation store** (`ca_issued_certs`)
  that backs OCSP/CRL.

The **online revocation-distribution surface is now served** (`EXC-REVOKE-01`):
the running binary mounts an RFC 6960 **OCSP responder** at `/ocsp/{tenant}` (GET
base64-in-path and POST `application/ocsp-request`) and an RFC 5280 **CRL
endpoint** at `/crl/{tenant}`, and runs a background **freshness scheduler** that
regenerates each tenant's CRL ahead of its `nextUpdate`. A query for a revoked
serial returns `revoked` over OCSP and the serial appears on the CRL within the
freshness window; a query for an issued-but-not-revoked serial returns `good`; an
unknown serial returns a signed `unknown`. These endpoints are **public by RFC
design** (relying parties check status without credentials) but run on the API
bulkhead pool, so an OCSP/CRL flood sheds rather than starving the rest of the
control plane (AN-7).

OCSP responses and CRLs are **signed through the out-of-process signer** (AN-4):
the signing op crosses the `internal/crypto` boundary (`SignOCSPResponse` /
`CreateCRL`) using the same signer-held CA key (a purpose-bound `RemoteSigner`)
the leaf path uses, so the CA private key **never materializes in the control
plane** — only the digest crosses. Every query is tenant-scoped under RLS (AN-1),
and each published CRL emits a `ca.crl.published` event (AN-2).

This is exercised end to end in CI (issue → revoke → assert OCSP returns
`revoked` (and `good` before revocation) and the CRL lists the serial within the
freshness window, with both signatures verifying against the issuing CA, driven
over real HTTP against the assembled binary and the real out-of-process signer).

The **CDP/AIA pointers** stamped on issued leaves are operator-configured
(`TRUSTCTL_CA_CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS` / `_OCSP_SERVERS`, PKIGOV-001) because the
externally reachable URL is deployment-specific; point them at the binary's
`/ocsp/{tenant}` and `/crl/{tenant}` (behind your ingress) so relying parties
discover and fetch revocation status automatically. trustctl revocation is now
both authoritative in the product's own inventory/records **and** publishable to
external relying parties over served OCSP/CRL.

## Single sign-on (OIDC only)

trustctl's interactive SSO is **OIDC only**: the UI and CLI authenticate against any
OpenID Connect provider (Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD, Okta, Ping, Google, Auth0,
Keycloak, and the like), and API/CI access uses scoped API tokens. **SAML 2.0 is
not supported.** PRD F13 originally named SAML as a Phase-1 SSO method, but trustctl
is **OIDC-only by decision** (R4.1): OIDC covers the modern identity-provider
landscape, and SAML's XML-signature handling is a security-sensitive surface we
chose not to carry. A SAML 2.0 Service Provider is a candidate for a future epoch —
it would route through the existing `internal/crypto` boundary (AN-3) — but it is
**not present today**, and no part of the product claims it is.

## CA key custody

The assembled issuing CA's key is now **persisted, sealed at rest** in the
signer's key store (R3.2): a signer restart **preserves** the CA instead of
silently rotating it, and the key survives across restarts. **HSM/KMS-backed
custody** (rather than a local sealed key file) and a served, m-of-n break-glass
flow are still future work — the key-encryption key is a local file by default.
See the [key-ceremony runbook](runbooks/key-ceremony.md),
[incident response](runbooks/incident-response.md), and
[disaster recovery](disaster-recovery.md).

**In-memory custody of the reference-path CA keys (CRYPTO-005 / SIGNER-008).** The
private-CA hierarchy (`internal/crypto/ca`) holds its live ECDSA signing keys in
**locked secret buffers** (mlock + `MADV_DONTDUMP`, AN-8) rather than as a bare
`*ecdsa.PrivateKey` on the Go heap for the lifetime of the in-process CA; the key
is reconstructed only for the instant of each signature and the transiently parsed
copy is best-effort zeroized afterward (the same hardening as the signer's
`LockedSigner`, SIGNER-008). This narrows — but, given Go's runtime, does not
eliminate — the window in which an unprotected key sits in dumpable heap; it is
complemented process-wide by `RLIMIT_CORE=0` / `PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0`.

**BYOK / HSM key lifecycle (`EXC-CRYPTO-01`).** trustctl provides a full
bring-your-own-key / HSM key lifecycle behind the AN-3 boundary
(`internal/crypto/byok` for in-process keys, `crypto.RemoteKeyLifecycle` +
`internal/kms/*` for HSM/KMS-resident keys), covering **generate-or-import →
rotate → revoke → zeroize** for CA/issuing signing keys and the secrets
key-encryption key (KEK):

- every transition is **event-sourced** (AN-2) through an injected event sink and
  is recorded with the key's identity, version, and public key — never its private
  bytes;
- key material lives only in **locked, zeroizable memory** (a `secret.Buffer`-backed
  `LockedSigner` / `LocalKEK`, AN-8), never a `string`; on rotate the superseded
  material is destroyed and on zeroize the buffer is wiped, after which the key can
  no longer sign or wrap (fail-closed);
- for an **HSM/KMS-resident** key the private key never enters the control-plane
  address space at all: rotate mints a successor at the provider, revoke disables
  the key (the provider refuses further signatures), and zeroize schedules the
  provider's destruction of the material — the durable custody story.

Today these are **library-tier capabilities** with end-to-end tests; the served
REST/gRPC verbs that drive this lifecycle from the running control plane (and a
served, m-of-n break-glass flow) remain the wiring tracked under `EXC-CRYPTO-01`.
The signer's at-rest CA key is still sealed under a local key-encryption file by
default. See the [key-ceremony runbook](runbooks/key-ceremony.md),
[incident response](runbooks/incident-response.md), and
[disaster recovery](disaster-recovery.md). The remaining external residual of
`EXC-CRYPTO-01` is the **product NIST CMVP certificate** (see
[compliance → FIPS](compliance.md#fips-cryptography--a-fips-capable-build-path-pkigov-007--exc-crypto-01)),
a lab process software cannot perform.

**Signer UDS peer-uid is Linux-only (WIRE-009 / SIGNER-006).** The signing service's
Unix-domain-socket listener authenticates the connecting process's uid via
`SO_PEERCRED`, which exists only on **Linux** — the supported production target
(Docker/Helm). On non-Linux hosts the peer-uid layer is unavailable and the access
control is the `0700` socket directory + `0600` socket alone; the listener accepts a
connection whose uid it cannot determine. This is defense-in-depth, not the primary
control, and the rejection path is now covered by tests so a regression that breaks
the uid comparison is caught in CI.

## Post-quantum cryptography (issuance algorithms)

trustctl's cryptography sits behind one boundary (AN-3, `internal/crypto`), and the
post-quantum support lives there — ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and the hybrid scheme in
`internal/crypto/pqc`, and SLH-DSA in `internal/crypto/slhdsa.go` — all built on
Cloudflare's CIRCL. What is available today:

- **ML-DSA** (FIPS 204; `mldsa44` / `mldsa65` / `mldsa87`) — the NIST-standard
  lattice signature.
- **ML-KEM** (FIPS 203; `mlkem512` / `768` / `1024`) — the NIST-standard key
  encapsulation.
- **SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+** (FIPS 205; `SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s` / `128f` / `192s` / `256s`) —
  the NIST-standard stateless **hash-based** signature, delivered in the Epoch 14
  post-quantum-migration work. Its security rests only on the hash function, so it is
  the conservative choice for long-lived roots where you want assumptions independent
  of the lattice schemes; the trade-off is much larger signatures.
- **A hybrid signature** (`HybridEd25519Dilithium3`) — classical Ed25519 paired with
  ML-DSA, so breaking either component alone does not forge a signature.

Private key material is held in locked, zeroized buffers (AN-8) and parsed only for
the moment of each operation, exactly like classical keys. The discovery side knows
these algorithms too — the **CBOM** scanner recognizes ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and
SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+ as quantum-safe when it finds them in your estate. Because all
cryptography enters through the single AN-3 boundary, each scheme is a contained,
one-package registration (a CIRCL scheme plus known-answer tests), with no ripple
into the rest of the system.

What is **not yet** end-to-end is PQC *issuance through every enrollment protocol* and
the fully automated, fleet-wide **migration orchestration** — the crypto primitives
are in place and the migration tooling is being built out. See
[Lifecycle & PQC](features/lifecycle-and-pqc.md) for the current state of that
tooling (F57).

## Kubernetes deployment

The control plane ships a production-shaped **Helm chart** (`deploy/helm/trustctl`):
the API/UI with the **signing service isolated** (its own locked-down, network-
unreachable sidecar), external PostgreSQL and NATS as the default, a default-deny
`NetworkPolicy`, and TLS. Two things are **deliberately deferred to S15.1**:

- **A Kubernetes Operator.** A CRD-driven operator is planned (S15.1); today the
  Helm chart is the supported control-plane install.
- **Multi-replica HA.** The chart now runs the control plane **multi-replica by
  default** (`replicaCount: 2`, `RollingUpdate maxUnavailable: 0`, PodDisruptionBudget,
  pod anti-affinity), and running >1 replica is **safe** (RESIL-002 / RESIL-004 /
  EXC-RESIL-01): **leader election** (a PostgreSQL session-scoped advisory lock) gates
  the continuous background workers — the outbox dispatcher, audit retention,
  idempotency/outbox GC, the projection tailer, the CRL scheduler, and the read-model
  snapshot worker — to exactly one replica so they never double-apply, with automatic
  failover to a follower on leader loss; all replicas serve reads. A **shared signer
  key store** (`persistence.signerKeysAccessMode: ReadWriteMany`) means every pod's
  locked-down sidecar signer (AN-4, UDS-only) loads the SAME sealed issuing-CA key, so
  all replicas are the same CA (first-boot provisioning is serialized by an advisory
  lock). The one piece still deferred is the **isolated signer** (`signer.mode:
  isolated`): a single signer pod serving all replicas over **mTLS gRPC**, which would
  let the signer scale independently. That cross-node transport is not yet implemented
  (the `trustctl-signer` binary is UDS-only), so selecting it **fails the Helm render**
  with guidance rather than shipping a crash-looping pod (OPS-001 / SIGNER-005); it is
  not required for the HA above. See
  [disaster recovery → High availability](disaster-recovery.md). (The agent,
  separately, runs as a DaemonSet across all nodes.)

## How to read the roadmap against this

The [README capability table](https://github.com/imfeelingtheagi/trustctl#capabilities)
describes what is **built and tested**; this page tells you what is **served by the
binary today**. When the two differ, this page is the authority for what you can
rely on at runtime.
