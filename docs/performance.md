# Performance SLOs

This page is the committed performance contract for the served trstctl hot paths.
It is intentionally concrete: every row has a `PERF-SLO-*` identifier, an owner,
latency targets, a minimum smoke-throughput target, queue/projection limits, and a
benchmark name. The local smoke gate writes the current measurement receipt:

```sh
scripts/perf/run-local.sh --profile smoke --out /tmp/trstctl-perf-smoke.json
```

The committed baseline receipt is `scripts/perf/artifacts/smoke-baseline.json`.
The smoke profile is a fast CI guard over representative product code paths. It is
not a substitute for the served live-load receipt, a multi-hour soak, or a
customer-specific load test, but it turns the hot-path denominator into executable
release evidence.

## Served live-load gate

The served live-load profile boots the local eval perf stack, drives every
`PERF-SLO-*` hot path through an HTTP handler, and exercises the signer path through
the generated signer gRPC service over an in-memory `bufconn` transport. That keeps
the committed receipt runnable in restricted CI while still measuring the served
RPC request path rather than a protobuf-only library shortcut. Customer load runs
should swap the signer transport to their production UDS or mTLS placement.

```sh
make perf-live
scripts/perf/run-local.sh --profile live --out /tmp/trstctl-perf-live.json
```

The committed live receipt is
`scripts/perf/artifacts/live-load-baseline.json`. Each SLO row must have both
`realistic` and `peak` phase measurements with p50, p95, p99, max latency,
throughput, error count, queue saturation, projection lag, and resource metrics.
The live profile is still a local eval-stack receipt, not a promise that one vendor
SKU will satisfy every production tenant shape; customer capacity reviews should run
the same profile against their chosen datastore, signer placement, and connector mix.

## Endurance / soak gate

Sustained-load behavior — memory/heap/goroutine/FD leak slopes, DB-pool saturation,
projection/outbox lag, queue rejects, signer restarts, and storage growth — is held
to a pass/fail threshold contract by an executable **soak gate**:

```sh
make soak                      # self-test: an induced leak series MUST fail, a healthy series MUST pass
scripts/perf/soak.sh --in <series.json> --out <report.json>   # analyze a captured sustained-load series
```

The threshold contract and the trend analyzer are shared by this gate, `make soak`,
and these docs so they consume one denominator — the same pattern as the smoke gate.
The gate exits non-zero on a leak slope or an SLO breach and emits a JSON trend
report.

## Gates

The fast local gate:

```sh
scripts/perf/run-local.sh --profile smoke
```

The served local live-load gate:

```sh
make perf-live
scripts/perf/run-local.sh --profile live
```

The Go benchmark denominator (the `Benchmark*` targets named in the SLO table
above), and the broader benchmark discovery command used for release review:

```sh
go test -run '^$' -bench=. ./...
```

CI runs the smoke profile and uploads the JSON receipt as a workflow artifact.
Release review compares the smoke receipt, the served live-load receipt, and the
capacity model in `docs/performance-capacity.md`.
