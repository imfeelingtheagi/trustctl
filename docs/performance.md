# Performance SLOs

This page is the committed performance contract for the served trstctl hot paths.
It is intentionally concrete: every row has a `PERF-SLO-*` identifier, an owner,
latency targets, a minimum smoke-throughput target, queue/projection limits, and a
benchmark name. The local smoke gate writes the current measurement receipt:

```sh
scripts/perf/run-local.sh --profile smoke --out /tmp/trstctl-perf-smoke.json
```

The committed baseline receipt is `scripts/perf/artifacts/smoke-baseline.json`.
The smoke profile is a fast CI guard over representative product code paths. It is
not a substitute for a multi-hour soak or a customer-specific load test, but it
turns the hot-path denominator into executable release evidence.

## Gates

The fast local gate:

```sh
scripts/perf/run-local.sh --profile smoke
```

The Go benchmark denominator:

```sh
go test -run '^$' -bench=. ./internal/perf
```

The broader benchmark discovery command used for release review:

```sh
go test -run '^$' -bench=. ./internal/...
```

CI runs the smoke profile and uploads the JSON receipt as a workflow artifact.
Release review compares that artifact with the capacity model in
`docs/performance-capacity.md`.
