# Runbook: incident response

This runbook is for the credential-security incidents a private CA must be ready
for: a compromised or suspected-compromised key, an unexpected certificate, or a
credential leak. It assumes you operate trustctl per the other runbooks
([backup/DR](../disaster-recovery.md), [migrations](../migrations.md),
[key ceremony](key-ceremony.md)).

> **Maturity note.** Some response capabilities (CRL/OCSP revocation, the CA
> hierarchy) are implemented and tested as library code and not yet served by the
> binary — see [Current limitations](../limitations.md). Where a step depends on an
> as-yet-unserved subsystem, this runbook says so and gives the operational
> alternative.

## First moves (any incident)

1. **Declare and timestamp** the incident; assign an incident lead.
2. **Preserve evidence.** Take a backup of the event log and database
   ([DR runbook](../disaster-recovery.md)) before making changes — the event log is
   the immutable source of truth (AN-2) and your forensic record.
3. **Verify the audit chain.** trustctl's audit trail is a hash-linked, signed chain
   (R2.1). Verify it (`audit.VerifyChain`) to confirm the record has not been
   tampered with and to establish a trustworthy timeline of who did what
   (`Actor` is recorded on every event).
4. **Scope the blast radius.** Identify the affected credentials and everything that
   depends on them (the credential graph models reachability and blast radius;
   library-level today — until served, enumerate dependents from inventory).

## Scenario: signer / CA key compromise

The issuing CA key lives in the out-of-process signer (AN-4); its compromise is the
worst case.

1. **Contain.** Stop the signer to halt new issuance (issuance fails closed without
   it). Isolate the host.
2. **Assess.** Use the audit chain to determine what was issued during the exposure
   window.
3. **Rotate the CA** via an m-of-n [key ceremony](key-ceremony.md) — provision a new
   issuing CA key in the signer's key store; do not reuse the compromised one. The
   signer **persists and seals its CA key and preserves it across restarts** (R3.2),
   so rotation is a **deliberate re-key**, not an automatic restart side-effect:
   per the key ceremony, replace the signer's sealed key store with the new CA key,
   then restart the signer so it adopts it, and re-issue under the new CA.
4. **Revoke** the compromised CA and any suspect leaves. Revocation (CRL and OCSP)
   is implemented in `internal/ca/revocation`; publish updated CRLs / OCSP responses
   to relying parties. Until revocation is served end to end, distribute the new CA
   bundle and shorten trust by re-issuing.
5. **Re-issue** active credentials under the new CA and **redeploy** them to their
   targets.
6. **Recover** any lost state from backup ([DR runbook](../disaster-recovery.md)).

## Scenario: unexpected certificate (mis-issuance)

1. trustctl's **Certificate Transparency monitoring** watches your domains and raises
   an alert on issuance it does not recognize (library-level today; when served it
   notifies on unexpected issuance).
2. Confirm whether the certificate is yours (check inventory) or truly unexpected.
3. If unexpected and for your domain, treat it as a CA-trust incident: revoke,
   rotate if your CA issued it in error, and notify per policy.

## Scenario: leaked leaf credential or key

1. **Revoke** the affected certificate and **rotate** the credential (issue a
   replacement, deploy it, retire the old one on the lifecycle state machine).
2. **Audit** for misuse during the exposure window using the audit chain.
3. **Rotate any shared secrets** the credential could reach (use blast-radius scope).

## Communications & closeout

- Notify affected owners and relying parties per your disclosure policy
  ([SECURITY.md](https://github.com/imfeelingtheagi/trustctl/blob/main/SECURITY.md)).
- Capture a timeline from the audit chain; write a post-incident review with
  concrete follow-ups (shorter validity, tighter custody, added monitoring).
- Confirm `/readyz` is green and the inventory is consistent before closing.

| Backup / restore | `trustctl --backup` / `--restore` | yes |
| Rotate the CA | m-of-n [key ceremony](key-ceremony.md) | library (Go API) |
| Revoke (CRL/OCSP) | `internal/ca/revocation` | library |
| Unexpected-issuance alert | CT monitoring | library |
