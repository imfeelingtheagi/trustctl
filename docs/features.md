# Feature index

trstctl tracks **78 capabilities**. This page is the traceability matrix: every
feature, its ID, and the page that explains it the trstctl way — *what* it is, *why*
it exists, and *how* it works, for a reader who starts with [zero
knowledge](glossary.md). The index is not a blanket GA-served claim for all 78
rows: served-state metadata is enforced in `internal/featureparity/feature-map-backlog.json`
as `served_state`, with the allowed values `served`, `conditional`, `partial`,
`library`, and `roadmap`. The same JSON records `api_surface`, `api_na`,
`cli_surface`, and `cli_na`; `internal/api` and `internal/cli` FeatureParity tests
verify that every named OpenAPI operation/CLI command exists, or that the row has
an explicit N/A reason. It also records `facet_evidence` for the served, UI, CLI,
API, test, docs, RBAC, audit, telemetry, a11y, and i18n facets. The
`FeatureFacetCoverage` test fails if any row is missing evidence or an explicit
N/A, and GA-ish rows (`served`, `conditional`, `partial`) must carry concrete
evidence for the facets that always apply to the shipped operator surface. RBAC is
tracked through feature-authz manifests: `/api/v1` rows bind each OpenAPI operation
to a route permission or public credential-exchange rationale, while protocol rows
bind ACME/EST/SCEP/CMP/SSH/SPIFFE/TSA mounts to either `certs:request` or an
explicit protocol-public rationale plus tenant/principal mapping.

This page is the answer to "where is feature X documented?" Each capability has a
**primary page** that teaches it; some are also referenced from related pages and
from the honest [Current limitations](limitations.md) account of what the running
binary serves today versus what is built as library code.
