# Build on the API, CLI, and SDKs

## Goal

When you finish this journey you will have driven trstctl programmatically: fetched
its API contract, scripted it from the CLI, called it from a typed SDK with retries
and idempotency handled for you, paged through a large result set with cursors, and
queried the credential graph. It is for an integrator or platform engineer wiring
trstctl into automation, CI, or another service. In plain terms: trstctl is
data-driven — one route registry generates the spec, the server, and the CLI — so you
can pick the surface that fits (raw HTTP, CLI, or a generated SDK) and they all stay
in lockstep.

## Before you start

- A running control plane and an API token, set up in
  [Getting started](../getting-started.md). Mutations and the graph need a token.
- The shape of the API, idempotency, and pagination are described in
  [Platform & API](../features/platform-and-api.md); the typed clients in
  [Client SDKs](../features/client-sdks.md); and the graph/query layer in
  [Graph, query & AI](../features/graph-query-ai.md).

## Steps

1. **Fetch the OpenAPI 3.1 contract.** Every route is declared once and published as a
   single spec — no auth needed to read it:

   ```sh
   curl -fksS https://localhost:8443/api/v1/openapi.json
   ```

   You should get the full OpenAPI 3.1 document. Point your code generator or API
   tooling at it; the spec, server, and CLI cannot drift apart.

2. **Drive it from the CLI.** `trstctl-cli` maps each command straight to an API
   route and auto-supplies an `Idempotency-Key` on mutations:

   ```sh
   export TRSTCTL_SERVER=https://localhost:8443
   export TRSTCTL_TOKEN=trst_...
   trstctl-cli certificates list --limit 50
   ```

   You should see the certificate inventory as JSON on stdout (exit `0` on success).
   The CLI is provably at parity with the API — see
   [Platform & API](../features/platform-and-api.md).

3. **Call a mutation with your own idempotency key.** Every state-changing request
   takes an `Idempotency-Key`; a retry with the same key returns the original result
   instead of acting twice. The CLI exposes it as a flag:

   ```sh
   echo '{"kind":"workload","name":"payments"}' \
     | trstctl-cli owners create -f - --idempotency-key my-stable-key
   ```

   You should see the owner created once; re-running the exact command returns the
   same owner rather than creating a second.

4. **Use a typed SDK instead of hand-rolling a client.** trstctl ships supported Go
   and TypeScript SDKs pinned to the served contract, with auth, idempotency, retries
   (honoring `Retry-After`), problem+json errors, and cursor iterators built in:

   ```go
   import (
       "context"
       "log"

       trstctl "trstctl.com/sdk/go/trstctl"
   )

   func main() {
       client := trstctl.New("https://localhost:8443", "trst_...")
       ctx := context.Background()

       // Cursor pagination: the iterator follows next_cursor across pages.
       it := client.Certificates(trstctl.CertificateListOptions{ListOptions: trstctl.ListOptions{Limit: 50}})
       for it.Next(ctx) {
           cert := it.Value()
           log.Printf("certificate %s: %s", cert.ID, cert.Subject)
       }
       if err := it.Err(); err != nil {
           log.Fatal(err)
       }
   }
   ```

   You should see each certificate printed as the iterator transparently follows
   `next_cursor`. The Go and TypeScript surfaces and their behavior are in
   [Client SDKs](../features/client-sdks.md).

5. **Page a large list over raw HTTP with cursors.** List endpoints return
   `{ items, next_cursor }`. Pass the returned cursor back to get the next page:

   ```sh
   curl -fksS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRSTCTL_TOKEN" \
     "https://localhost:8443/api/v1/certificates?limit=50&cursor=<next_cursor>"
   ```

   You should get the next page of `items` plus a fresh `next_cursor` (absent on the
   last page). Over-budget callers get `429` with `Retry-After`.

6. **Query the credential graph.** Ask how things connect through the served graph
   surface — a typed, allow-listed query, not raw SQL:

   ```sh
   trstctl-cli graph query 'MATCH (w:workload)-[:OWNS]->(c)-[:DEPLOYED_TO]->(r) WHERE w.name = "payments-svc" RETURN c, r.name'
   ```

   You should see the matching nodes, scoped to your tenant. The graph and the unified
   query layer behind it are in [Graph, query & AI](../features/graph-query-ai.md).
