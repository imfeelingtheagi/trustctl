# Issue and trust SSH access at scale

## Goal

You will replace the pile of standing SSH keys in everyone's `authorized_keys` with
short-lived SSH certificates from a single authority. The outcome is hosts that trust
*one* SSH certificate authority, users who get certificates that expire on their own
(say, valid until 5 p.m.), and a clean inventory of any leftover keys still granting
access. This is for an operator who wants central, time-bounded, auditable SSH access
instead of per-host key copying. The running binary serves the CA, KRL, attested-cert,
rollout-evidence, revocation, and retirement handoff; host file mutation remains in the
operator-confirmed agent path.

## Before you start

- A running control plane and an API token from
  [Getting started](../getting-started.md) (`trstctl token create`).
- The CLI/API pointed at your server via `TRSTCTL_SERVER` and `TRSTCTL_TOKEN` — see
  [Getting started](../getting-started.md).
- An installed agent on the hosts you want to manage, enrolled as in
  [Getting started](../getting-started.md). For what the agent can see and change on a
  host, see [SSH](../features/ssh.md).

## Steps

1. Turn on the SSH certificate authority and bind it to your tenant. The CA's key lives
   in the separate signing service under a handle constrained to SSH-cert signing — it
   never enters the API process. See [SSH](../features/ssh.md).

   ```yaml
   protocols:
     ssh:
       enabled: true
       tenant_id: "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
   ```

   -> the SSH CA is served at `/ssh/...`, and its binary key-revocation list at
   `/ssh/krl` (the artifact a host's `RevokedKeys` consumes). The toggle is off by
   default and startup fails closed if you enable it without a tenant.

2. Find the SSH access you already have, so you know what the certificates are
   replacing. Create an `ssh` discovery source and queue a run; trstctl records host
   keys and standing-access grants — and flags an `authorized_keys` grant whose owner is
   unknown as orphaned. Only fingerprints are stored, never private keys. See
   [Discovery & inventory](../features/discovery-and-inventory.md).

   ```sh
   cat > ssh-source.json <<'JSON'
   {"kind":"ssh","name":"fleet","config":{"targets":["10.0.0.10:22"]}}
   JSON
   trstctl-cli discovery sources create -f ssh-source.json
   echo '{"source_id":"<source-id>"}' | trstctl-cli discovery runs start -f -
   trstctl-cli discovery findings list --run_id <run-id>
   ```

   -> you get a list of standing-access keys to retire as certificates take over. The
   SSH discovery control surface (source/schedule/run/findings) is served; the host-key
   scan executes from the agent/library connector — see
   [Discovery & inventory](../features/discovery-and-inventory.md).

3. Make your hosts trust the CA's public key. The CA's key goes into a host's
   `TrustedUserCAKeys` file, referenced from `sshd_config`. The agent does this
   *additively* and safely, and this trust-rewrite is a high-blast-radius change, so it
   is **off by default** and requires an explicit opt-in plus confirmation. See
   [SSH](../features/ssh.md).

   ```sh
   trstctl-agent --enroll-url https://localhost:8443 \
     --bootstrap-token-file ./trstctl-bootstrap-token \
     --server localhost:9443 \
     --name edge-agent-1 \
     --ca-bundle ./trstctl-ca.pem \
     --ssh-trust-add-ca \
     --ssh-trust-confirm \
     --ssh-trust-reload-cmd 'systemctl reload sshd' \
     --ssh-trust-health-cmd 'ssh -o BatchMode=yes localhost true'
   ```

   What the agent writes for you, additively:

   ```text
   # /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/trusted_user_ca_keys
   ```

   -> the agent backs up the files, validates the new config (`sshd -t`), reloads, runs
   your post-reload health command, and auto-rolls-back to the last-known-good on any
   failure — so a bad rewrite cannot lock you out. It never removes existing trust
   without an explicit confirmation. Record the served rollout evidence after the agent
   reports the result:

   ```sh
   trstctl ssh trust-rollout \
     --source <source-id> \
     --hosts edge-1.internal \
     --ca-fingerprint SHA256:... \
     --reload-cmd 'systemctl reload sshd' \
     --health-cmd 'ssh -o BatchMode=yes localhost true' \
     --rollback-plan 'restore trusted_user_ca_keys backup and reload sshd' \
     --status health_passed \
     --confirm
   ```

4. Issue a short-lived user certificate tied to a verified identity, not handed to
   anyone who asks. The attested issuer runs an attestation check first and only then
   derives the certificate's principals from the verified result, defaulting to a short
   TTL. Every issuance is an immutable `ssh.cert.issued` event. See [SSH](../features/ssh.md).

   ```sh
   trstctl ssh issue-attested-user \
     --method k8s_sat \
     --payload-base64 "$K8S_SAT_B64" \
     --public-key "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" \
     --key-id jit-deployer \
     --ttl-seconds 900
   ```

   -> the user connects normally and `sshd` validates the certificate against the
   trusted CA with no stored key. Access expires on its own — no standing key left
   behind. The attestation-gated issuer is served through the SSH workflow API/CLI/UI and
   still keeps the private key with the user, never in trstctl.

5. Pull a certificate back before it expires. Revoking it puts its serial on the SSH
   CA's key-revocation list, served in OpenSSH binary format at `/ssh/krl`, which a
   host's `sshd` consumes via its `RevokedKeys` directive. See [SSH](../features/ssh.md).

   ```sh
   trstctl ssh status
   trstctl ssh revoke --serial <serial> --reason 'operator requested revocation'
   curl -fsS "$TRSTCTL_SERVER/ssh/krl" -o trstctl.krl
   trstctl ssh retire-host --host edge-1.internal --source <source-id> --run <run-id> --reason 'standing SSH access replaced'
   ```

   -> a revoked certificate is reported as revoked by stock `ssh-keygen`; budget for
   pushing the updated KRL to hosts, since distribution is push-based.

## Where next

- [migrate-from-existing-ca.md](migrate-from-existing-ca.md) — do the same
  consolidation for X.509 certificates.
- [onboard-a-team.md](onboard-a-team.md) — isolate each team's access in its own
  tenant.
