# Give your Kubernetes workloads an identity

## Goal

When you finish this journey, your Kubernetes services will prove *what they are* and
receive short-lived certificates from trstctl — with **no static secret** baked into
any pod to be copied into logs, images, or git. It is for platform teams running
services on Kubernetes that need service-to-service identity (mutual TLS, SPIFFE)
without long-lived API keys. In plain terms: instead of planting a permanent
password in each pod, the workload presents proof of its identity at the moment it
needs access, and gets a pass (an SVID) that expires in minutes.

## Before you start

- A running trstctl control plane with a provisioned issuing CA. Bring one up via
  [Issue your first certificate](first-certificate.md) or
  [Getting started](../getting-started.md).
- A Kubernetes cluster whose service-account token signing keys (its JWKS) trstctl
  can verify against — this is the trust source for pod attestation.
- An API token exported as `TRSTCTL_TOKEN` to drive the CLI (from the
  first-certificate journey).
- A workload-side SVID consumer: `spiffe-helper`, a go-spiffe client, or an
  Envoy SDS integration.
- If you want cert-manager to write Kubernetes TLS Secrets, cert-manager installed
  in the cluster and a trstctl API token with certificate-issue permission.
- If you already run SPIRE, access to the SPIRE server configuration and a trstctl API
  token with certificate-issue permission for the upstream CA.

## Steps

1. **Understand the building block: attestation before trust.** Before issuing
   anything, trstctl demands proof of the workload's identity and verifies it. For
   Kubernetes the relevant method is the **projected service-account token**
   (`k8s_sat`), verified against the cluster's JWKS — a forged token is rejected and
   nothing is signed (fail-closed). The full attestation chain (TPM, AWS, GCP, Azure,
   Kubernetes, GitHub OIDC) is covered in
   [Workload identity](../features/workload-identity.md).

2. **Enable the SPIFFE Workload API.** trstctl serves a SPIRE-compatible Workload API
   as a gRPC service on a Unix domain socket. Turn it on and bind it to your tenant:

   ```yaml
   protocols:
     spiffe:
       enabled: true
       tenant_id: "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
   ```

   You should see the control plane mount the Workload API on the socket at startup.
   It activates only when an issuing CA is provisioned.

3. **Register the workloads as managed identities.** Model each service as a
   non-human identity through the served CLI (this is idempotent — a retry never
   creates a duplicate):

   ```sh
   trstctl-cli identities create -f service-account.json
   ```

   You should see the identity created with its lifecycle state. The non-human
   identity lifecycle (created, scoped, rotated, disabled, retired) is described in
   [Workload identity](../features/workload-identity.md).

4. **Use cert-manager when Kubernetes should own the TLS Secret.** Install the
   trstctl cert-manager CRDs and agent DaemonSet, then create a `ClusterIssuer`
   that points at a served trstctl CA issue endpoint:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: trstctl.com/v1alpha1
   kind: ClusterIssuer
   metadata:
     name: trstctl
   spec:
     signerURL: https://trstctl:8443/api/v1/ca/authorities/<ca-authority-id>/issue
   ```

   A cert-manager `Certificate` can then use that issuer:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: Certificate
   metadata:
     name: web
     namespace: apps
   spec:
     secretName: web-tls
     dnsNames:
       - web.apps.svc.cluster.local
     issuerRef:
       name: trstctl
       kind: ClusterIssuer
       group: trstctl.com
   ```

   You should see the trstctl `ClusterIssuer` become Ready, cert-manager create a
   `CertificateRequest`, the trstctl agent sign the CSR through the served issue
   endpoint with an idempotency key, and cert-manager write `Secret/web-tls`.
   The token used by the agent lives in a mounted Kubernetes Secret file, not in
   command-line arguments.

5. **Use native Kubernetes CertificateSigningRequests when you want the built-in
   API.** A Kubernetes client can create a `certificates.k8s.io/v1`
   `CertificateSigningRequest` with `spec.signerName: trstctl.com/trstctl` (or
   `trstctl.com/<issuer-name>`). Kubernetes or a separate approver must mark the
   CSR `Approved`; the trstctl agent only signs approved requests and writes
   `status.certificate` plus Ready=True.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
   kind: CertificateSigningRequest
   metadata:
     name: web
   spec:
     signerName: trstctl.com/trstctl
     request: <base64-der-csr>
     usages:
       - digital signature
       - key encipherment
       - server auth
   ```

   You should see `trstctl-cli kubernetes csr` report CAP-K8S-04 as served,
   including the status-only RBAC rules. After approval, the CSR status contains
   the issued certificate chain; no workload private key crosses into trstctl.

6. **Use SPIRE when it is already your workload identity plane.** Configure trstctl
   as SPIRE's upstream authority: build or package
   `trstctl-spire-upstream-authority` into the SPIRE server image, mount the trstctl
   API token as a file, and point SPIRE at the served CA authority:

   ```hcl
   UpstreamAuthority "trstctl" {
     plugin_cmd = "/opt/spire/plugins/trstctl-spire-upstream-authority"
     plugin_data {
       endpoint = "https://trstctl:8443"
       ca_authority_id = "<ca-authority-id>"
       token_file = "/run/secrets/trstctl-spire-token"
       common_name = "SPIRE Server CA"
       ttl_seconds = 3600
       max_path_len = 0
       permitted_dns_domains = ["example.org"]
     }
   }
   ```

   On startup, SPIRE creates its local CA key, sends the CA CSR to
   `POST /api/v1/ca/authorities/{id}/intermediates/csr`, and receives a signed
   intermediate plus the trstctl root. You should see SPIRE continue minting normal
   X.509-SVIDs, but their chain now ends at the trstctl CA you govern and audit.

7. **Fetch a short-lived SVID from inside a pod.** A workload that passes attestation
   presents its selectors (e.g. `k8s:ns:default`, `k8s:sa:web`) over the socket; the
   server matches them against registration entries and returns an SVID plus the
   trust bundle. With a stock client this is a `FetchX509SVID` call for mTLS or a
   `FetchJWTSVID` call for an audience-bound JWT; the same served socket also answers
   `FetchJWTBundles` and `ValidateJWTSVID`. You should see the workload receive an
   X.509-SVID or JWT-SVID for a single `spiffe://` URI identity, signed through the
   separate signing service, that expires in minutes, not months. The wire details are in
   [Workload identity](../features/workload-identity.md).

8. **Confirm there is no static secret to steal.** Because the SVID is short-lived
   and minted only after attestation, there is nothing long-lived in the pod to leak,
   and even a captured credential is useless within minutes. A `NeedsRotation` helper
   flags an SVID for renewal once it is half-expired, so the workload renews itself.
   You should see SVIDs rotating on their own with no secret material at rest in the
   pod spec.

9. **See the workloads land in inventory and the graph.** Each attested identity and
   its credential are recorded, so you can find them like any other credential:

   ```sh
   trstctl-cli certificates list --limit 50
   ```

   You should see the workload identities tracked alongside everything else trstctl
   knows about. How the inventory is built and what else discovery finds is covered
   in [Discovery & inventory](../features/discovery-and-inventory.md).
